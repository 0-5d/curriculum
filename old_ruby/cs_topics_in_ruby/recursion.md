# Recursion

Recursion is the idea that a function calls itself.  Pretty simple, right?  It's used to take a big problem and start breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces and continuing to feed those back into the original function until some sort of answer is achieved and the whole chain unwinds.  

There's also a right and wrong way to use recursion.  The fact is, any problem you can solve recursively you can also solve using the iterators that you know and love.  If you find yourself saying "why didn't I just use a `while` loop here?" then you probably should have.  You won't often end up using a recursive solution to a problem, but you should get a feel for when it might be a good idea.

## Your Assignment

1. Read the [Chapter on Recursion](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/recursion/) in the Bastards Book of Ruby by Dan Nguyen
2. Watch this [Video on Recursion](http://vimeo.com/24716767) by Joshua Cheek but only until minute 17:45!  (don't want to give away the project...)

## Test Yourself

1. Complete the [Code Quiz](http://www.codequizzes.com/computer-science/recursion) on Recursion.
