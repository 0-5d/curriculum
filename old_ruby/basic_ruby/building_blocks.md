# Ruby Building Blocks
*Variables, Data Types, Strings, Methods*

## Intro

Welcome to Ruby Basics!  Since you've already done a decent chunk of Ruby in the [Web Development 101 Section](/curriculum/web_development_basics/web_programming_basics/back_end_basics/ruby_basics.md) (if not, go do that first!), this should start as a quick refresher of what you've already learned.  

Get stretched out and warmed up, it's time to dive in!

## Your Assignment

1. You should have already completed [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) in the Web Development 101 section to start with.
2. Do the full [Codecademy Introduction to Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) section if you haven't already.
3. Complete the [Codecademy Introduction to Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) project ("Putting the Form in Formatter")
4. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 2: `Programming == Joy: A Whistle Stop Tour of Ruby and Object Orientation`
5. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 3: `Ruby's Building Blocks: Data, Expressions, and Flow Control` pages 31-50 (only the section on Numbers and Expressions and the section on Text and Strings)
