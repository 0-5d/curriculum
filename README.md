#The Odin Project: Curriculum
==========

## The open curriculum for learning web development.

The Odin Project supports students who aspire to become web developers using an open curriculum focused on collaborative and project-based learning.  We encourage participation and contribution from both students of the project and the professional developers who will one day seek to hire them.
