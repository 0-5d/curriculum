#The Odin Project: Curriculum

### The open curriculum for learning web development.

The Odin Project supports students who aspire to become web developers using an open curriculum focused on collaborative and project-based learning.  We encourage participation and contribution from both students of the project and the professional developers who will one day seek to hire them.

**It takes approximately 1000 hours to go from zero to employable as a web developer** and it's often a confusing and overwhelming journey.  When you ask a developer how to learn, you usually get a dozen vague resources to look at and a gentle nudge forward.  This curriculum is designed to provide a clear path forward that utilizes existing (and free) content on the web to get you to where you'd like to be.  

Check our our [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Learn-Web-Development-Paired-Programming-in-SF) if you'd like to follow the development of The Odin Project and participate in our in-person pairing meetups.  We will shortly be introducing a way to find each other to pair online as well.

### Our Philosophy

Our philosophy is that you learn most effectively by building things, by working with other people as much as possible, and by having actual context for what you're learning.  

### How it Works

The units here are meant to break down into approximately 20% learning / 80% building.  Each step of the way, you should be able to see your progress through the projects you've built and by how far you've progressed along the path laid out here.  We'll also do our best to answer the question "So why the heck do I need to know this anyway?".  If one piece of content has you stuck, we'll have links to additional resources to help shore up your understanding.

This curriculum is just a suggested path... you don't necessarily need to do things in this order but you'll probably be a bit lost later on if you're missing some key foundational knowledge.
