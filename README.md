#The Odin Project: Curriculum

## The open curriculum for learning web development.

The Odin Project supports students who aspire to become web developers using an open curriculum focused on collaborative and project-based learning.  We encourage participation and contribution from both students of the project and the professional developers who will one day seek to hire them.

It takes approximately 1000 hours to go from zero to employable as a web developer.  This curriculum is designed to utilize existing (and free) content on the web to get you to that level.  Check our our [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Learn-Web-Development-Paired-Programming-in-SF) if you'd like to follow the development of the program and participate in our in-person meetups.
