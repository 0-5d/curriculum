# The Odin Project
## The Open Curriculum for Learning Web Development

This repository is the curriculum for [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com).  It is available for free to anyone who would like to learn web development in a project-focused and collaborative environment.  

Students, educators, and developers are encouraged to make contributions to the curriculum.  It has been greatly simplified so that should be rather straightforward -- just fork this repository, make your changes (e.g. adding the link to your solution for one of the exercises), then submit a pull request.  The URLs presented on [theodinproject.com/curriculum](http://theodinproject.com/curriculum) match up directly to the folder structure here.

*For more information about contributing, see the [Contributing Page](/contributing.md).*

Happy Coding!
