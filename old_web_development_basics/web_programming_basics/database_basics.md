# Databases
Estimated Time: ??? hrs

## You should know:
* What is a database?
* What are relational databases?
* How are relational databases different from XML?
* What is SQL?
* What does CRUD stand for?
* Why is CRUD so important for web apps?

We've talked about the client-side and the server-side but how do we keep ahold of all our user's data?  Who remembers that your login password is CatLover1985 so you can sign into the website?  The bottom layer of any web application is the database and it handles all the remembering for you (we'll cover caching much later).  It can be relatively simple, like an excel spreadsheet, or incredibly complex and split into many giant pieces like Facebook's.

Databases are one of those aspects of web programming that are kind of hidden in the back and so people treat them with a sort of suspicion and awe.  That's nonsense and you should get over it -- your database and you are going to become very good friends (or frenemies).  By the end of this curriculum, you're going to understand what's going on with your databases and be able to interact with them like a pro (and probably better than some people you'll work with).

Compared to a normal language, SQL (Structured Query Language), which is used to query databases, is a very simple syntax... there are only a small handful of verbs to learn.  What trips people up is that you need to be able to visualize in your head what it's going to be doing.  We'll spend a fair bit of time on SQL and databases because they're so fundamental, but for now we'll just cover enough to get you familiar with what's going on.

## Assignment:
1. Check out a pretty good plain-english explanation of SQL, written by Zed Shaw, at [Learn SQL The Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/introduction.html).
2. Sign up for Coursera's [Intro to Databases](https://class.coursera.org/db/lecture/index) course and watch the lectures on Relational Databases and SQL (~3 hrs).  You can save the sections in between (relational algebra, XML, JSON) for extra credit (things get a bit technical there).
3. Do the [Automated Assignments](https://class.coursera.org/db/quiz/index) for the SQL section to get a jump on your understanding for the SQL unit we'll be doing later.  Try working with a pen and paper next to you to draw pictures of what's going on.  Again, you can save the additional sections for extra credit.
