## Macro Level: From Client to Developer and Back

TODO: client team handoff, scrum, cards/stories, gogo, circle back, scrum.... debrief.

## Micro Level: What You Do as the Developer

TODO: tech used, who gets spoken to, where debugs are usually needed, when tests are written, how deployment goes, interactions with other team members.

*Are you an experienced developer?  We'd love to find out what exactly the life cycle of a project looks like.  Please [email us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) if we can do a quick interview about it and post it here!  If you know of a good interview on the web that does the same thing, please let us know about that as well.*
