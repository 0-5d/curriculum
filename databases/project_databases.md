# Project: Databases and SQL
Estimated Time: 4-8 Hours

It's tough to read a bunch of stuff and then "know" how to build good queries.  In the end, it comes down to a conceptual understanding of how the pieces fit together -- can you visualize what's happening when two tables are joined?  The best way to acquire this is practice.  Break out a pen and paper and write down what you think is going on.

## Quick Quiz

This quiz shouldn't take long at all, but if you didn't score better than a 17/20, you should consider rereading some of the material.

## Project: SQL Zoo

## Your Task

In this project, you'll use the SQLZoo website to practice writing SQL queries.  Some of them will be easy, others will be quite difficult.  Stick with it... in the end, you'll know a lot more about writing queries than you did going in.

Go to [http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page) and do tutorials 1-10 from the left panel.  Use the sidebar links as reference.

## Solutions

* Some of the solutions are listed at the bottom of the main page (thus far they are only available for the first two sections)
* Solutions for the "More Join Operations" section are available [HERE](http://www.gideondsouza.com/blog/solutions-to-sqlzoo.net-more-join-operation-questions-movie-database#.UjuLHGRgbKw).
