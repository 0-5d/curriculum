At this point, you should have a comfortable grounding in the nuts and bolts of how databases basically work and how to write SQL queries to manipulate them.  That understanding will be helpful when we begin our dive into ActiveRecord, which is the part of Rails that actually talks to the database for you.  With ActiveRecord, you still construct the same sorts of SQL queries, but using the Ruby syntax instead.

If you're still unsatisfied with your understanding of how databases work, you might consider taking a look at [Coursera's free online databases course](https://www.coursera.org/course/db).  I wouldn't consider it a core part of this curriculum since it gets fairly in-depth and academic at times, but should be noted as a good resource for further understanding.

So what comes next?  Rails!  You've got all the building blocks laid out... you know Ruby well, you're (relatively) comfortable with git, you understand how data is persisted and stored and you've even got a broad understanding of the front end stuff like HTML/CSS and Javascript.  The only thing left to do is mash that all together and learn how to produce a real web application.
