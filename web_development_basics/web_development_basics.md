# Web Development Basics

## Intro

Now that you know what web developers do, it's time to start thinking about how they actually do it.  In this unit, we'll learn about how the Web works and start thinking about the basics of computer and web programming.  

Each of the following sections represents essential baseline knowledge.  Even if you have no intention of becoming a web developer yourself, this material should help you gain a useful understanding of the moving parts involved in creating and serving content on the web.  

For the first time, some of the sections below will ask you to do exercises to help build your understanding.  Give it a shot!

## Step Back... How Does Your Computer Work?

This isn't a course about rebuilding your hard drive but it is useful for you to understand the high level overview of what's going on to make your computer function.  That's partly because you'll see the same patterns showing up when you're telling servers what to do and partly because you're going to have to talk to your computer in a way that it understands anyway so you'd better speak a little of its language.

### The Command Line

Raise your hand if you're scared of the command line.  Yes, we have this image of developers staring at a black screen with white or green text flashing across while they wildly enter incomprehensible commands and hack into the corporate mainframe (spilling soda and wiping cheetos off their keyboard no doubt as well).  

That black screen (or window) is the command line, where you're able to enter commands that your computer will run for you.  And while that image of a programmer is a bit overdone, the command line really is sort of like our base of operations, from which we'll launch other programs to do our "real developing" in.  It has a syntax of its own which is different but not all that difficult to pick up.  You'll be entering the same commands dozens of times anyway, so you'll get pretty good at it in a short period of time.

## Finish

Now you've gotten your feet wet and I hope you're getting curious to dig deeper.  You should be fairly comfortable typing commands into your computer's command line and you should understand what happens when you enter a web address into your browser and it returns a functioning page.
