# Finish

Now you've gotten your feet wet and I hope you're getting curious to dig deeper.  You should be fairly comfortable typing commands into your computer's command line and you should understand what happens when you enter a web address into your browser and it returns a functioning page.  You should be able to create a basic web page and make it do some basic things with Javascript.  You should also be able to write a simple Ruby script, test it, and describe what Rails and Backbone actually are.  Finally, you should have a clear understanding of how all this fits together in your future as a builder of web applications.

With what you know already, you could start putting together some basic websites or further your knowledge on your own.  But we're here to help you get a lot further than that -- to the point where you can confidently build a full-featured and scalable web application, whether on your own or working as a developer in a top tier tech company.  Buckle up, because we're heading straight into Ruby and we won't come out until you can confidently build a Twitter spambot and a chess game (among many other things).  The journey has just begun!
