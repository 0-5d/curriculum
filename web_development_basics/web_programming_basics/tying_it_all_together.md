# Tying it All Together
Estimated Time: 1 hr

You've got an idea of what the pieces look like, now it's time to see how they all dance together in a typical Ruby on Rails application.  Read through [The Anatomy of a Web Application](http://www.buildingwebapps.com/transcript/79327-anatomy-of-a-web-application) (you can listen to audio of it by clicking the link on the left side) and pay particular attention to what's happening on the client vs the server side.  It gets a bit more into the guts of what Rails is doing, and this will be a valuable first step towards understanding what you'll be building later on.
