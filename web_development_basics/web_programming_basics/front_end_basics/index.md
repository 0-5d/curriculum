# Front End Basics
Estimated Time: 20-30 hrs

The "front end languages" live in the browser.  After you type in an address in the address bar at the top and hit Enter, your browser will receive at least an HTML file from the web server.  That file will likely tell the browser to go and also ask for a CSS file and a Javascript file as well.  Each of these languages performs a separate but very important function and they work harmoniously together to determine what the web page IS, how it LOOKS, and how it FUNCTIONS.  And keep in mind that your browser handles figuring out how to make these files into a functioning webpage (not the server).

## Assignment:
1. Get a high level overview of how all three languages (and jQuery) work together in a web page in this brief learn.jquery.com post on the [Anatomy of a Web Page](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/getting-started/).
2. If you didn't the first time, check out [this 10-minute video on your browser's developer tools](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TkfcC53G0), which should make a bit more sense to you anyway now.
