# Back End Basics
Total Estimated Time: 20-30 hrs

The three languages of the front end are fairly standardized -- HTML for presentation, CSS for markup, and Javascript for scripting.  The back end is a different story... you can run pretty much anything you want to on your server since it doesn't rely on you user's browser understanding what's going on.  All the browser cares about is whether you've sent it properly formatted HTML, CSS and Javascript files (and other assets like images).  That's led to a whole lot of different choices for back-end languages.  As long as it can take in an HTTP request and spit out some HTML, you can probably put it on a server somehow.

That said, some languages are more popular and practical than others.  If you're running your own server, you have a ton of flexibility but plenty of headaches.  If you're deploying to the cloud (which we will be doing later), you may be restricted to those languages which your cloud provider has installed on their platform... it doesn't do you much good if the servers you're "borrowing" from them can't understand your code!  Some of the most popular are PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, Python and Java (not to be confused with Javascript).  And just like I can say "which way to the nearest pub?" in Swedish, French, Italian, English and Bad English, all of those languages can perform almost exactly the same functions.

One difference between the work you did on the front end and what you'll be doing on the back end is that you'll need to make sure you have some things installed prior to actually building these projects in the back end.  Your browser automatically knows how to run HTML, CSS, and Javascript for you but your computer probably doesn't have Rails installed.

## Assignment:
1. Go to the [Installations Unit]({{site.url}}/dir/installations/) and get everything installed if you haven't already.  It can sometimes be a frustrating process but you'll need to get it done eventually so don't wait.  That includes setting up git and your Github account, even if you're not quite sure yet what they are.
