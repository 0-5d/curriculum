# Contributing

## Work In Progress!

This project is very much a work-in-progress and benefits heavily from the contributions of everyone from students to teachers to developers.  We welcome contributions in three main areas:

#### 1. Content

Almost all the content is sourced from free pre-existing videos, blogs and tutorials.  If we're trying to teach something and you know there's a better resource out there, put it in the "Additional Resources" section.  Same goes for alternate but useful explanations of the material.  If you've got high quality material on your own blog or website, feel free to do the same.  Content with an obvious commercial angle (like marketing videos) should only be used if there is no reasonable substitute.

#### 2. Exercises and Projects

This is a project-driven curriculum so having useful and interesting projects that break down to address specific content modules is crucial.  We rely heavily on others to give us project ideas and to begin breaking them down into a checklist of deliverables.  Ultimately, we'd also like to have specs created for each project as well.  If you can help on any of those levels, please contribute!

We will also be instituting quizzes at the beginning and end of various sections.  If you know of or have created any interesting problems that address a particular area of content (especially if they come with specs), please send them our way!

#### 3. Curriculum

This curriculum is built to pave the way between new students and industry.  If you're a developer and have a strong opinion about something you believe jr devs are lacking these days and should be included in the curriculum, let us know!  If you're a student and have gone through a unit and still don't feel like you understand something well enough, tell us so we can beef up that section!

## Attribution

As you can tell, we highly value and rely on the help of the developer and student communities.  We'd like to do as much as we can to identify our top contributers and the providers of high quality content.  While the curriculum resides on Github, we'll maintain a top contributers list in addition to the commit histories.  Should it migrate to an independent platform, we'll still do our best to attribute both the content and submission source for their contributions to the project.  Contributers taking a more active role in the project may be invited to join the core team as well.
