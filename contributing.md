# Contributing

This project is very much a work-in-progress and benefits heavily from the contributions of everyone from students to teachers to developers.  

## What to Contribute

### 1. Content

Almost all the content is sourced from free pre-existing videos, blogs and tutorials.  If we're trying to teach something and you know there's a better resource out there, put it in the "Additional Resources" section.  Same goes for alternate but useful explanations of the material.  If you've got high quality material on your own blog or website, feel free to do the same.  Content with an obvious commercial angle (like marketing videos) should only be used if there is no reasonable substitute.

### 2. Exercises and Projects

This is a project-driven curriculum so having useful and interesting projects that break down to address specific content modules is crucial.  We rely heavily on others to give us project ideas and to begin breaking them down into a checklist of deliverables.  Ultimately, we'd also like to have specs and a canonical solution created for each project as well.  If you can help on any of those levels, please contribute!

We will also be instituting quizzes at the beginning and end of various sections.  If you know of or have created any interesting problems that address a particular area of content (especially if they come with specs), please send them or the links to them our way!

### 3. Curriculum

This curriculum is built to pave the way between new students and industry.  If you're a developer and have a strong opinion about something you believe jr devs are lacking these days and should be included in the curriculum, [let us know!](mailto:feeback@theodinproject.com)  If you're a student and have gone through a unit and still don't feel like you understand something well enough, tell us so we can beef up that section!

### Also...

This whole website is open source (the source code for the website itself is [on Github HERE](http://github.com/theodinproject/theodinproject)) and there's plenty that you can do to help, even if it's just squashing bugs and writing tests.  Check out the [README](https://github.com/theodinproject/theodinproject) for more info and the [Development Roadmap](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/blob/master/dev_roadmap.md) for an idea of what's being worked on now and what's coming up soon.


## How to Contribute

There are three main ways to contribute to the curriculum (see the [main website's repo](https://github.com/theodinproject/theodinproject) for how to contribute there), in order of preference:

1. **Pull Request:**  To contribute, [fork the curriculum repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), make your changes or additions, then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

2. **Github Issue:** You can also [open up a Github issue](https://github.com/theodinproject/curriculum/issues) instead and we'll take care of it.  *[About Github Issues](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/issues)*

3. **Email:** [Email us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) your suggestions directly.  If you have questions about The Odin Project itself, [contact us here](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com).

If you're adding a solution to one of the projects, first save it in your own repository and then just make a link to it in the appropriate project's section.  Be sure to give your partner acknowledgement if you have one and they want it.

If you're unfamiliar with the Markdown (.md) syntax that's used in these files, it's really straightforward and there's a great guide for it from [Daring Fireball here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

### Attribution

As you can tell, we highly value and rely on the help of the developer and student communities.  We'd like to do as much as we can to identify our top contributers and the providers of high quality content.  We'll be maintaining a top contributers list in addition to the commit histories.  Contributers taking a more active role in the project may be invited to join the core team as well.

## Thank you for your help and support!
