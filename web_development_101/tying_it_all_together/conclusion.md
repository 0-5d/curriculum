That was quite a journey.  Take a second and reflect on the fact that you've just learned the basics of at least three different languages and, if you had to, you could probably hack together a web page on your own already.  

You should be fairly comfortable typing commands into your computer's command line and you should understand what happens when you enter a web address into your browser and it returns a functioning page.  You should be able to create a basic web page and make it do some basic things with JavaScript.  You should understand the purpose of backend code and how frameworks make it easier to write clean and maintainable code.  Finally, you should have a clear understanding of how all this fits together in your future as a builder of web applications.

With what you know already, you could start putting together some basic websites or strike out to increase your knowledge on your own.  However, we're here to help you get a lot further than that, to the point where you can confidently build a full-featured and scalable web application, whether on your own or working as a developer in a top-tier tech company.  

You've come a long way up the learning curve but there is so much more cool stuff that you'll learn to do, and now is the time to decide which path you want to take. Either Ruby with Ruby on Rails or JavaScript with Node/Express. Both paths will guide you in building skills, building up a portfolio of projects and becoming a great developer. There is no right answer here on what is the next best path. Learning a different language can help you become a more well rounded developer, but sticking with one the whole way through could make you more of an expert in the lanaguage itself. Both paths will help you become a great developer. The important thing is to not switch halfway though, this will only set you back.

Learning how to program is **much** more than just learning a language. It's about learning how to research and solve difficult problems, building an engineering mindset, working on complex problems and codebases, communicating effectively with other developers, and **much** more. Luckly all these skills are transferrable to other languages and domains of software and because most languages are similar in concept and structure, it will be easy to move into a new language with far less difficulty than learning your first one. 

Arguments about learning the languages used in your area may sound convincing, but because a _good_ developer can transfer skills easily, what you learn isn't going to change outcomes of getting a job much. Though, if you cannot shake that fear, do whatever you need to just stay on the train and finish the course. 

In the end, it doesn't matter which path you take, it's only important that you stick with it, and continue to hold onto the learner's mindset throughout your career.

Buckle up, because this is only the beginning. Now it's time to delve deeper into the areas covered by Web Dev 101. There are some fantastic projects in the courses that follow which will challenge you to the limit, but you'll come out the other side ready to go and make your mark in the programming world. 

The journey has just begun!
