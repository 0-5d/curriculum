## Javascript Testing with Jasmine

We won't get deep into Javascript testing but, suffice it to say, it performs a similarly valuable function as RSpec did in Ruby and Rails.  Without testing, you have no idea when you've broken something important in your app or, as importantly, when exactly it actually stopped working.

### Points to Ponder

* Why should I test my Javascript?
* What tools are out there to test Javascript with?
