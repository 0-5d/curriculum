## The Basics and the Browser

### Description

We'll zoom through the basics of Javascript and how it's used in the browser with jQuery.  This where things get really fun, since you get to immediately see everything you're building in the browser.  By the end of this section, you'll actually know everything you need to build fun and interesting front-ends but, of course, it's really just the beginning.

1. How This Course Will Work
    /introduction.md
2. Javascript Basics
    /js_basics.md
3. PROJECT: Javascript Basics
    /project_js_basics.md
4. jQuery Basics
    /jq_basics.md
5. PROJECT: Messing with the DOM
    /project_jq_basics.md
9. Additional Helpful Stuff
    /additional_stuff.md


## Events and Effects

### Description
Events drive just about everything you'll do with Javascript in the browser. We'll take a closer look at how they work and the kinds of things that they allow you to do.

6. Working with Events and Effects
    /events_effects.md
7. PROJECT: jQuery and the DOM
    /project_events_effects.md
8. Building Widgets
    /widgets.md
9. PROJECT: Widgets
    /project_widgets.md

## Deeper into Javascript

### Description
You can do a lot with just basic Javascript, jQuery and a hacker mindset.  But this section will take you deeper into how Javascript is actually doing things and it will give you the tools to produce more advanced functionality for your sites.  Some of the previous projects have probably tested the boundaries of your understanding of Javascript, and here we'll fix that.

1. Objects, "Classes", and Prototypes
    /objects_prototypes.md
2. Javascript Scopes and Closures
    /scopes_closures.md
3. PROJECT: Javascript Scopes and Closures
    /project_scopes_closures.md
4. Comparing Javascript and Ruby: Going Functional
    /comparing_to_ruby.md
5. Deep Dive into Functions
    /deep_dive_functions.md
6. PROJECT: Not-So-Basic Javascript
    /project_functions.md

## Advanced Browser Work

### Description
There's a whole lot more to using Javascript in the browser than just manipulating simple DOM elements with jQuery.  If you want to grab data from external sites or your own back end, submit forms, or handle more complicated games, you'll need to dig deeper into how Javascript handles things like callbacks.  Here we'll also cover how to build games using HTML5's `<canvas>` element, which let you use Javascript logic to draw shapes.  

1. Taking Javascript to the Browser
    /js_to_browser.md
2. Living in an Event-Driven World
    /event_driven.md
3. Organizing Your Code
    /organizing.md
4. PROJECT: Callback Madness
    /project_callbacks.md
5. Using Canvas to Draw and More
    /canvas.md
    Once you can use canvas, you're only limited by your creativity (and maybe your geometry skills).
6. PROJECT: Arcade Games with Canvas
    /project_canvas.md

## Submitting Data with AJAX

### Description
In this section you'll learn about AJAX, the technology which allows you to send data from the browser to your web application without needing to refresh the page.  It's commonly used with forms, but really represents a whole world of possibility for crafting performant user experiences.


1. Front End Forms and jQuery
    /jquery_forms.md
2. PROJECT: Front End Forms
    /project_forms.md
3. Using AJAX to Talk to Your Server
    /ajax.md
4. PROJECT: AJAX and Forms
    /project_ajax_forms.md

## Linking to APIs and Your Rails Back End

### Description
A real web app needs a back end in order to persist its data and do sensitive operations.  Here you'll learn how to handle use AJAX to send data requests to your Rails backend.  You'll also get a chance to work with external APIs like Google Maps, which is something you'll probably find yourself doing quite frequently as you build your own projects in the future.

1. Working with Javascript APIs
    /javascript_apis.md
2. PROJECT: Putting Google Maps Onto Your Site
    /project_apis.md
    Just about every business has a contact page with a map pointing to their location.  Build one with the Google Maps API.
3. Working with a Rails Back End and API
    /rails_backend.md
4. PROJECT: Where's Waldo (A Photo Tagging App)
    /project_rails_backend.md

## Server Side Javascript and Single Page Apps (Optional)

### Description
This is an optional section where you will learn about using Javascript to run your server (instead of Ruby) and also about Javascript frameworks which let you build a full website as a single page run by Javascript to create blazing fast user experiences.

1. Node.js and Server-Side Javascript (Optional)
    /server_side_js.md
2. PROJECT: Node.js
    /project_node.md
3. Javascript Templating (Optional)
    /templating.md
4. Javascript MV* Frameworks Like Angular.js (Optional)
    /js_frameworks.md
5. PROJECT: Backbone.js or Angular.js
    /project_js_frameworks.md
6. Workflow Tools, Tech Stacks and Dependency Management (Optional)
    /workflow_tools.md


## Finishing Up with Javascript

### Description
You've learned everything you need and all that remains to do is apply that knowledge to a worthy task.  In this section, we'll briefly cover how to test Javascript using Jasmine and then get you started with your capstone project so you can show off your range of skills.

7. Javascript Testing with Jasmine
    /js_testing.md
8. PROJECT: Final Project
    /project_final_js.md
9. Conclusion
    /conclusion.md
