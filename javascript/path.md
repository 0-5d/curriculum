### Lessons

## The Basics and the Browser

### Description
You've already completed the [Web Development 101 course](/courses/web-development-101/lessons#section-the-front-end), right?  Good, because now we'll be moving at warp speed into new frontiers.  This section will cover a lot of ground and your brain may melt down a few times, but don't worry, that's just a flesh wound.  Patch 'er up and keep going!  When in doubt, build something.

This is also where things get really fun, since you get to immediately see everything you're building in the browser.  You'll create everything from games to browser widgets along the way.  By the end of this section, you'll know everything you need to build fun and interesting front-ends.  But, of course, it's really just the beginning.  The real trick is building *well* and, ultimately, integrating your front-ends with your back ends.  Gogogo!

## Deeper into Javascript

### Description
You can do a lot with just basic JS and jQuery and a hacker mindset, as you saw in the last lesson on widgets.  But this section will take you deeper into how Javascript is actually doing things and will give you the tools to produce more advanced functionality for your sites.  The Snake game and the last project on the jQuery image slider probably tested your understanding of how Javascript works and showed you that there's still a lot to understand.

1. Objects, "Classes", and Prototypes
    /objects_prototypes.md
2. Javascript Scopes and Closures
    /scopes_closures.md
3. PROJECT: Javascript Scopes and Closures

5. Deep Dive into Functions
    /deep_dive_functions.md
6. PROJECT: Not-So-Basic Javascript
    /project_functions.md

## Advanced Browser Work

### Description
There's a whole lot more to using Javascript in the browser than just manipulating simple DOM elements with jQuery.  If you want to grab data from external sites or your own back end, submit forms, or handle more complicated games, you'll need to dig deeper into how Javascript handles callbacks.  

We'll also cover how to build games using HTML5's `<canvas>` element, which let you use Javascript logic to draw shapes.  Once you can do that, you're only limited by your creativity (and maybe your geometry skills if you're building complex ballistics games).

1. Taking Javascript to the Browser
    /js_to_browser.md
2. Living in an Event-Driven World
    /event_driven.md
3. Organizing Your Code
    /organizing.md
4. PROJECT: Callback Madness
    /project_callbacks.md
5. Using Canvas to Draw and More
    /canvas.md
6. PROJECT: Arcade Games with Canvas
    /project_canvas.md

## Linking the Browser to You Back End

### Description
A real web app needs a back end in order to persist its data and do sensitive operations.  That's not to say you can't outsource the functionality to a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) company like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) or [Apigee](http://apigee.com/), but you've already got the skills yourself! You can link to the back ends you created in the course on Ruby on Rails.  

In order to do this, you'll need to learn more about using forms. That will take us into AJAX, which allows you to submit forms without needing to refresh the page.  You'll end up relying on it more and more as you optimize your front ends for performance.

It'll also be helpful to understand how to integrate an external API with your front-end page, like adding a small Google Map to show where your business is located, so we'll cover that as well.

## Server Side Javascript and Single Page Apps

### Description
This is the section where we go beyond using Javascript as a facilitator of great looking and great running pages and into using Javascript as the main tool for creating those pages in the first place.  We'll talk about using Javascript to run your server (instead of Ruby) with Node.js and about the many Javascript MV* Frameworks out there which let you build a full website as a single page run by Javascript for blazing fast user experiences.

Much of the content in this section can be considered "supplemental" to the core needs of getting hired, but also incredibly interesting and helpful if you *do* know it.
