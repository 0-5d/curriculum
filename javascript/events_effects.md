## Working with Events and Effects

Events are at the heart of Javascript -- they are how you turn user interaction with your website into responsive actions.  The key to working with events is just building a model in your head for how the browser "listens" for events by default and how you can use that to your advantage.

Effects are like window-dressing for your user experience.  They represent the neat transitions (like fades or slides) that you can easily apply to elements using jQuery.

### Points to Ponder

* What are Events?
* How do you bind an event to an element?
* How do events "bubble" through the DOM?
* How do you stop the default thing an event would do?
* How do you set up an event so it will also apply to elements created after you created the event listener? (hint: delegate)
* How do you unbind events from an element?
* How would you listen for a keyboard key being pressed?
* How do you make an element fade in or out?
* How do you change the amount of time it takes for an element to fade in or out?
* What happens if you trigger a whole bunch of effects on the same element at the same time (e.g. 12 slide-outs)?
