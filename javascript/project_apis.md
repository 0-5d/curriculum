## Project: Putting Google Maps Onto Your Site

Create a site that has a Google map on it and forms where the user can place markers based on latitude and longitude entered to the form.  Play around with the different options the Maps API gives you -- you can customize almost everything on a map, from the way the thumbtacks drop down to the colors of each element.
