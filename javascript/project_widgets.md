## Project: Widgets

Build a simple website that contains an image carousel / slider like the one seen at [jssor.com](http://www.jssor.com/) (but don't use theirs exactly).  It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backwards.  It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds.  It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be clickable to advance to that particular slide).  

Don't spend too much time worrying about getting your images to display at the correct size -- it's more important to get the slider sliding.
  
Advanced additions:  When you hover on the "next" or "previous" arrows, it should actually pop up a little tiny picture preview of the next slide's picture.  Make the slider continuous -- when it gets to the last slide, it should keep going forward to the first slide (without jumping all the way back to it... it should look like the "first" slide is just another "next" slide in the order).  Same is true if you go backwards past the first slide -- it should seamlessly transition to the last slide and back through the order.

*This is a nifty functionality to have on your personal website!*
