## Project: Front End Forms

Build a browser form that collects name and address information and uses live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not.  That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.  It doesn't need to actually submit, but you should give an error message if the button is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields.  If all is well and the form is "submitted", give the user a high five.  

Do all this using jQuery's Validate plugin but then try it without any plugins to challenge yourself.  See some of the readings for examples of setting up your own validators.
