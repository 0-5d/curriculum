## Project: Messing with the DOM

Generate a full page using just Javascript and jQuery (so your HTML should just be `<html>` and `<body>` tags to begin with).  Once you've actually added some elements to the page, work from the browser's developer tools Javascript console to play with grabbing and changing them dynamically.  

Next, make it a 1-page site which can actually display either page A or page B depending which tab the user selects across the top.  [Look at #7 on this hongkiat post](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/50-nice-clean-css-tab-based-navigation-scripts/) for visual inspiration.  Keep it simple -- when you click the next tab, your Javascript should automatically replace version A with version B in the content area (no page refresh required).
