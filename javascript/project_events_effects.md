## Project: jQuery and the DOM

Let's build a game that shuffles the DOM all over the place and listens for events -- [Snake!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game))  Remember that grid you created in the [Web Dev 101 jQuery project](/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery)...?  Turn it into a simple Snake game with one player who can control the direction of the snake by typing one of four keys.  You can use timeouts to simulate a game loop.

Not a Snake fan?  Try building [Minesweeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) instead (there are many variations -- just use an 8x8 grid of squares with 10 mines).  It isn't quite as realtime but requires you to think logically about how the Minesweeper game functions.
