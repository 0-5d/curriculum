## Project: Where's Waldo (a Photo Tagging App)

Build a [Where's Waldo?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where's_Wally%3F) game in the browser with a Rails backend.  You'll need to load up a game board image and then allow your user to click inside it.  When the user clicks, a dropdown menu should pop up which lets you select which character you've just identified.  

Once you select the character, use AJAX to validate that the selected location is within an acceptable distance of the "correct" location for that picture (which should be saved in your database by default).  If so, provide a "congratulations, you've found XYZ" message.  If not, highlight the selection box red and provide a useful error message.  Once the user has found all characters, give her a high five.
