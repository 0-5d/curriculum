## Final Project

Copy your favorite website as well as you can.  Seriously -- Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter... Just make sure it's got lots of interesting functionality.  You'll be integrating your full array of Rails and Javascript skills into this one.  You've got all the tools you need to build a website just like the ones you use every day.  You can't copy every single feature and a lot of the user interface will be a bit clunkier, but you can get yourself 80% of the way there.  

Try testing the very high level Javascript and Rails functionality with Jasmine and RSpec respectively.
