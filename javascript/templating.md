## Javascript Templating

Before we get into frameworks, it's useful to learn about templating tools.  Basically, these will let you set up a template (like a Rails layout/view) and insert basic dynamic elements (like loops) to it with minimal effort and without the need to build out a sophisticated back end to handle it.  You'll find that most templates feel a whole lot like ERB did in Rails views -- a way of passing snippets of dynamic code and variables into your HTML.

Some of the more common templating languages include [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) (so named because they typically use curly braces {{to surround}} inserted code).

### Points to Ponder

* What is a client-side template?
* How is this similar to ERB you used in Rails?
* How do you include Mustache.js in your project?
* How do you use Mustache to display a group of `<div>`'s?
