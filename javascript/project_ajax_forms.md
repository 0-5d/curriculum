## Project: AJAX and Forms
  
Work with [an existing free and open API called OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) to implement a form submission (with some validations too!) for a new movie.  

Create a "loading..." status while AJAX is processing.

Finally, create an infinite scroll that keeps loading movies using AJAX as you scroll down.
