# HTML and CSS Resources

Though this course is currently under construction, there are tons of great resources out there for learning HTML and CSS and we've started laying them out for you below.  The first place to start is definitely in the [Web Development 101 lesson on HTML and CSS](/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics), which covers a lot of ground to get you up to speed on the basics.  In fact, most of what you need to know to build effective websites is covered there.  

This course will be designed to follow that introductory material with more depth so you can start to flex your design muscles to produce more appealing and easy-to-use websites.  Luckily for you, there are an enormous amount of resources available on the web to learn front end development, so if you ever get stuck, Google is your friend.
