# HTML and CSS Resources

Though this course is currently under construction, there are tons of great resources out there for learning HTML and CSS.  The first place to start is definitely in the [Web Development 101 lesson on HTML and CSS](/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics), which covers a lot of ground to get you up to speed on the basics.  In fact, most of what you need to know to build effective websites is covered there.  

This course will be designed to follow that introductory material with more depth so you can start to flex your design muscles to produce more appealing and easy-to-use websites.

## A Possible Path

Here are a list of things you'll want to make sure to understand to get a good handle on HTML5 and CSS3.

### HTML

#### Basics
    
Document structure, tags, tag attributes, linking to external files...

#### Lists

Ordered and unordered lists are heavily used in most websites.

#### Linking

The difference between internal links (/somepage) and external links (http://www.somesite.com/somepage).  Navigating the document tree with links (../../someotherpage).  Opening links in external windows.

#### Images and Media

Common attributes of image tags.  Saving page load times by using appropriately sized images.  Storage of images externally.  Types of image files and how they are different.

#### Tables

When to use tables (hint: sparingly).  Structure of a table.

#### Forms

Why forms are probably the most important part of your site (hint: user friction).  Form construction and basic layout.  Element types.  When to actually use each element.  Linking linked elements together with names.  The relationship between names and what your back end receives.

#### New Stuff in HTML5

Semantic tags, canvas elements, more granular media elements with control features, local storage, data attributes, compatibility, remembering not to go too crazy with things.
