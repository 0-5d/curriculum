### Introduction

It's time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished. Not unless you're into [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) that is.

But It's important to keep in mind this project is just to build your HTML chops, we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
#### Iteration 1: Initial structure

1. Create a new directory `odin-recipes`
2. Within that directory create an `index.html` file, fill it out with the usual boilerplate html and add an `h1` heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.

#### Iteration 2:  Recipe Page

1. Create a new directory within the `odin-recipes` directory and name it `recipes`.
2. Create a new html file within the  `recipes` directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example `lasagna.html`. You can use the name of your favorite dish or if you need some inspiration,  you can [find a recipe to use here](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
3.  For now, just include a `h1` heading with the recipe's name as its content.
4. Back in the `index.html` file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

#### Iteration 3:  Recipe Page Content

The recipe page should have the following content:

1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on google or the site [recipe site](https://www.allrecipes.com/) we linked to earlier.
2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized "Description" heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
3.  Under the description, add an "Ingredients" heading followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe
4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "Steps" heading followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.

#### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

1. Add two more recipes with an identical page structure as the recipe page you've already created
2. Don't forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren't all on one line.
