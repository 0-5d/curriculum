### Introduction
Welcome! This course is all about teaching you **C#** (see sharp), a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Microsoft.

"*Woah, woah, woah, Microsoft?*"

Yep! The truth is, Microsoft is not the same company it was a decade ago. Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has made real strides in improving their tech and its accessibility. With .NET - which you will learn later in the **.NET Programming** course - C# can now run cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux machines with no hassle. Additionally, Microsoft rolls out updates to the language and ecosystem yearly. The .NET future has only grown brighter and brighter.

You'll do a healthy chunk of learning in this course, but by the end of it all, you'll have built some pretty sweet projects including **Tic Tac Toe**, **Hangman**, and even **Chess**. You'll be able to save and open files, write tests for your code, separate out your spaghetti code into nice, distinct classes, and even reproduce some basic algorithms and data structures to solve complex problems.

**Basically, you're going to start feeling a whole lot more like a real programmer, and that feeling will be justified. It's empowering!**

### Why Learn C#?
There's a number of reasons to look at when deciding if C# is worth the time to learn.

C# programming is a great starting point to branch out into all kinds of different programs. For example, many of you may have heard of the game development engine **Unity**. Game developers who work in Unity write C# code for their game logic! The incredibly popular, sandbox game **Terraria** was also written in C#. With C# knowledge, you can easily dive into desktop development, service workers, automation, and web programming - where we will be spending most our time.

An awfully neat thing is how C# works under the hood. We will dive into this later - so don't worry too much about the "how" right now - but C# sits on top of the **.NET runtime**. When C# code is compiled, it compiles to an **Intermediate Language(IL)** that is then executed by the runtime. The cool part is that C# is *not* the only language on top of the .NET runtime. What does this mean for us? 

Our apps can be partly written in C#, F#, and Visual Basic.NET. Both F# and Visual Basic *also* sit on the .NET runtime. F# is a functional programming language that is an absolute blast to use, and Visual Basic is an older language similar to C# that you can use if you want. Down the road, you could write F# code that C# code can then use! What's more: learning other .NET languages is *easy* once you're familiar with C#.

Another thing to consider: C# is *fast*. Performance checks for C# are also a huge pro for .NET devs (programmers who write C# professionally). As a result, C# is a consistent, reliable language to use for apps that rely on performance. This leads us into enterprise development: writing code for large companies that have unique software demands. Now that C#, .NET, and Microsoft have gone open-source, startups are beginning to explore C# for their apps as well.

Speaking of, arguably the most important reason to consider C# is how many .NET jobs there are. Knowledge of C# is becoming increasingly valuable in the software industry, and there simply aren't enough C# devs to meet business needs. It is the *best* time to get into the industry if C# interests you.

### The Path Ahead
C# is a big language with lots of syntax, living in a *rich* ecosystem. As a result, we've broken the concepts up into smaller chunks to make it more digestible. Some of the early material will be fairly straightforward and will rely on simple exercises to help reinforce your understanding. As you progress through the course, the goal is for you to get a much deeper and more practical understanding of the material. As you move into some of the more advanced topics, you'll be reading less and building more--just the way it should be!

* In the first section, you'll learn all about the basics of C# along with some classic programming basics.
* In the second section, you'll learn about object-oriented programming, which will show you how to cleanly and neatly organize your code into reusable objects.
* In the third section, you'll dive into files and serialization.
* In the fourth section, you'll learn the basics of test-driven development with Xunit.
* In the fifth section, you'll learn some more advanced C# and how to really superpower your C# programs.
* In the sixth and final section, you'll tie everything together by building a fully fledged chess game.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Read the [Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) of the C# documentation to learn more about the history of the language. Stop at the **Hello world** section.
2. This course assumes you are using VSCode as your text editor. For the best experience, we recommend you ensure you use it.

### Optional C# Materials
The resources listed below cover C# basics, and you may want to go through these on the side while going through the first section of this C# course. Repetition is the mother of all learning after all!

Consider the resources here optional, though we recommend them to help supplement your learning.

1. [The Codecademy C# course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp) covers C# basics and OOP basics.
2 [The version history of C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history) is neat to check as you learn more about the language. Once you finish the course, you'll wonder how C# devs ever survived without Linq!

### Okay, enough talk. Let's learn C#!
