# Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Resources

## Strategy

The first step is to have a strategy.  You've come this far with a deliberate and strategic approach to learning, why abandon it at the most important phase?  Getting a job can itself be a full-time job so use your time wisely and plan ahead.

Get your head out of the clouds, stop dreaming about how you'll get hired, and actually do it.  Hungry is not desperate.

1. build skills
2. build knowledge
3. apply knowledge
4. profit

## It Starts with YOU

### Where You Are Now

Without defining what your own needs are, you will have no way of determining the right path forward so hunker down until you've got an idea of what your key needs are right now from a job.

### Where You Want To Be

What will your future needs be?  What kinds of companies do you want to to work at?  What are your non-negotiables and your nice-to-haves?

### What Are Your Assets and Liabilities?

Hunger, drive, capability, personality, hopefully depth.  Actually building stuff.  Do you have people skills? Are you a tech geek? What's your background? Tough problems you've solved before?

## What Companies Want 

productive, curves, great fit, (capability, motivation and fit), 

### Life Behind the Curtain

Stories of a hiring manager at several levels

### Internships

The world is full of flaky people.  Get paid to prevent that.


## What You Can Do Beforehand (Way Beforehand)

A structured approach!

### Get Good!

Navigating this process can be a beast but don't let it distract you from building your skills, which ultimately will determine if you get the job or not.

### Build a Portfolio

Showcase technical depth, technical skill, social proof and working projects.

### Know your Strengths

As a newbie, your best assets are hunger, curiosity and growth.  Craft a narrative.

### Prepare your Portfolio

build a port, clean up your github etc, 
schedule and strategize your time btw hiring and assets.  NETWORK WITH DEVS!!!

### Clean up your Web Presence (and Have One)

Google yourself.  Set up profiles.  Be discoverable.  Leverage social proof.  Use LinkedIn if you can.  Get a twitter and tweet just enough that people feel like they might be able to reach you on it (that's how I find lots of people I ask questions of).

### Project: Build your Personal Website

In the simple, it's a direct conduit to YOU.  It doesn't have to be elaborate at all.  If you hate writing, don't blog.  But you need to be a real person.  Showcase your work.  Geek out.

### Get in the Community

Find and meet other developers.  That doesn't mean "power networking" but it does mean genuine human connection.  Your network of people DOES matter in a BIG way.  For now, it's probably just for answering questions and harvesting advice but your next job will probably be found through the people you know and some who you meet while you're harvesting advice.  People like giving advice and like investing themselves emotionally in growth curves.

That's best in person, where you can ask your dumb questions, but there are plenty of online communities as well.  Be a part of them.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's how you build relationships.

### Collect Information

You'll need to understand what the jobs are and what they're looking for. Start collecting postings and you'll start seeing similarities between them.  Yeah, it's shit work, but it must be done.  Ask people questions, it's faster than trolling through blog posts trying to figure out the process.  Buy lunches and coffees.  Get 5 people at least, set a goal for that.


## Collect Leads 

in an organized way (spreadsheet?) and your connection to them.  Direct is better than monster.  SPAM FB friends.

### The Best Places to Look

### On Recruiters

good for knowns, less good for unknowns


## Qualify leads

Have your personal decision criteria figured out (remember it from earlier?).  Expected value weight everything if you can and rate it based on your criteria, including the non-negotiables.  Simpler is better.

* How easily can I continue to learn at that job?
* Is there access to mentors and teaching?
* How good are my peers who I can learn from?
* How much would I like going into work each day?
* What are the job-security risks of the job? Corporations aren't lock-tight just because they're big... they go through restructuring phases and lay off people with little good reason
* Does it pay well enough to support me?
* Does its location fit the needs of me and my family?
* How long do I want this (first) job for?


## Reaching Out and Applying

### Resume Versions

Tailor your resume for the type of opportunity.  Remember they can see the title.

### Cover Letters

Be concise, stick to your benefits, be human, feel their perspective, be specific

### Go in the Side Door

go in the side door! Get noticed!

### Applying

Track everything. Trickle it out there (when it rains it pours).

### Following up

Track everything.  Followup 3-7-14 days and be nice.


## Interviewing and Preparing to Interview

Interviewing terrifies people

### How the process works once you're in the funnel

Phone Screen, tech interview, tech challenge, fit, offer, negotiation, acceptance.

### The Phone Screen


### The Tech Interview

Be curious, be honest, be open minded

### The tech challenge

Examples of take-home tech challenges

### The "Fit" stuff

Fit is actually the most important thing (for better or worse)

### Handling an offer -- comp, negotiate, and get THREE

Companies will drag their feet because they can.  You will drag your feet when you have multiple offer letters.  Don't take it personally but do what you can to fight it off.


## Alternate Paths

Do you not feel ready for work just yet?  Maybe you just skipped to this course and ignored the other ones.

### Bootcamps

_Perfect is the enemy of good - Voltaire._

Incidentally, you may be considering attending a full-time coding bootcamp to find a job. The majority of people shelling out money to attend a full-time coding bootcamp seeks to enhance their career prospects. Yes, there is a component of genuine interest and learning, but a clear expectation is that the programming courses offer an entry into a programming career. Some companies advertise 100% placement rate and six figure offers. How credible are these claims? Are such points relevant for your overall career search process?

If you're looking to be better informed about a full-time coding bootcamp and whether it might be useful to you, read this guide to help make your decision: [Choosing a Full-Time Coding Bootcamp](leanpub.com/choosing-programming-course)
