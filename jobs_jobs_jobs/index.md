Incidentally, you may be considering attending a full-time coding bootcamp to find a job. The majority of people shelling out money to attend a full-time coding bootcamp seeks to enhance their career prospects. Yes, there is a component of genuine interest and learning, but a clear expectation is that the programming courses offer an entry into a programming career. Some companies advertise 100% placement rate and six figure offers. How credible are these claims? Are such points relevant for your overall career search process?
