# Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Resources

You've been figuring out this web development stuff and building apps for a long time now and it's finally time to get paid to keep learning by working for someone else.  You're absolutely capable of getting a job but it's certainly not easy to find one.  You'll have to be honest with your self about what you want and what you can offer and tackle the challenge with the same rigor and structure that has gotten you this far.  It's not a given -- this is as much an odds game as anything is, especially for first-time employees who haven't been "proven" by past experience.

## Strategy

The first step is to have a strategy.  You've come this far with a deliberate and strategic approach to learning, why abandon it at the most important phase?  Getting a job can itself be a full-time job so use your time wisely and plan ahead.  There are some things you can and should do ahead of time, which we talked about a bit in the [lesson on Getting Hired in the Introduction to Web Development course](/courses/introduction-to-web-development/lessons/getting-hired-as-a-web-developer) but will cover in greater depth below.

The path to working takes the following form, which we'll cover in the sections below:

1. Figure out your needs and skills
2. Figure out what companies need and offer
3. Increase your odds by laying the groundwork early
4. Collect job leads
5. Qualify job leads
6. Reach out and apply
7. Interview
8. Handle the offer(s)
9. Profit??

You'll notice that it's quite structured.  Some things are more optional than others, but you've got to have a plan or you'll find yourself spamming your resume out to every job post on every job board and wondering why you haven't had any success. We'll also cover some alternate paths you can take like finishing up your education at a coding bootcamp and how you can contribute to open source projects (like this one) to boost your "real world" experience.

A fantastic place to start is this **[very thorough article from Happy Bear Software on How to Get A Programmer Job](http://happybearsoftware.com/how-to-get-a-programmer-job.html)** (which was also a part of the Intro to Web Dev course).

So get your head out of the clouds, stop dreaming about how you'll get hired, and actually do it.  

## It Starts with YOU

### Where You Are Now

Without defining what your own needs are, you will have no way of determining the right path forward so hunker down until you've got an idea of what your key needs are right now from a job.  The questions below should help you think about what is actually essential for you versus nice-to-have.  Ask yourself:

* Why do I *need* a job?
* What kind of salary level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
* What kind of job security level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
* How desperate am I to get a job *right now*?

* Do I prefer working in a team environment or remotely?
* Do I like working long hours or 9-6?
* Is the work more important than the people?
* Do I have to care about the product I'm building?
* Do I have to care about the technologies I'm using?
* Do I prefer an "easy" work environment or one where I'm constantly pushed?
* Do I want "creature comfort" incentives like free food and beer at the office?
* Do I have to enjoy my work or can I power through a crappy job?



### Where You Want To Be

Once you've been honest with yourself about your needs, it's time to figure out what you *want*.  What will your future needs be?  What kinds of companies do you want to work at?  

* Why do I *want* a job in web development?
* What kind of career path do I want to have?
* What are the

### Prioritizing Needs and Wants

You should have at least an informal list of the things that matter to you.  Now ruthlessly rank them.  What are your non-negotiables and what are your nice-to-haves?  Every company and opportunity will fall somewhere on the spectrum defined by those questions and they are the criteria you will later use to evaluate them.  This will help you stay focused when approaching opportunities and not spread yourself too thin chasing things that you wouldn't really choose anyway.

Make sure you know every one of your "must-haves" and your top 5 priorities for "nice-to-haves" in a job.  

### What Are Your Assets and Liabilities?

It's time to be honest with yourself... what do you bring to the table?  If you're early in your career (which you probably are), you'll have to work hard to distinguish yourself from the flood of unqualified candidates out there.  You need to strike the line between being honest with yourself and not selling yourself short.  Everyone, especially those just starting out, feels unqualified.  That's natural, so don't worry about it.  This is about figuring out your strengths and weaknesses so you can tailor your story to play to your strengths and honestly address your weaknesses.

Some questions to ask (which you'll probably hear again in your early interviews):

1. How hungry am I?
2. How good am I at building back end code?
3. How good am I at putting together front ends?
4. Can I solve really technical problems like brain teasers and algorithms?
5. Have I built projects that display a good range of skills?
6. Do I know people who can recommend me?
4. Am I a good people person who builds relationships easily?
5. Do I portray an aura of confidence or act shy?
5. Do I tend to undersell myself and my capabilities?
5. Do I have a broad level of general tech knowledge?
6. Am I very familiar with a particular technical or industry vertical? (Usually career switchers have one)
7. Do I tend to procrastinate or do I just get shit done?
8. Do I wait to ask for help or do I go out and find the answer on my own?
9. Do I lean in to challenges or avoid them?
10. What are some really difficult problems I've solved before?

Applying without much experience means you need to fill in your weak spots and emphasize your strengths.  For almost everyone, your biggest strength will be hunger and ability to learn.  But companies have heard that story before.

Just remember that there's a difference between hunger for opportunity and desperation.

## What Companies Want 

You can't get hired by just thinking about why *you* need or deserve the job.  You have to think about life from the perspective of the company and why they're interested in hiring your and what that makes them look for.

### Life Behind the Curtain

Hiring managers are busy people.  That's why they need someone new... to remove some of their workload and get their team working better or faster.   They also have to deal with potentially hundreds of applicants every week, which takes up too much of their valuable time.  They just want to get back to building stuff and not have to hire again anytime soon.  So they are looking for someone who can **add value as soon as possible** and who will be able to **grow with the organization.**

The second characteristic, growth, is something you shouldn't have much trouble selling if you've come this far and learned web development on your own.  The key is to present yourself as a growth curve, not just a static line (i.e. you'll continue learning and improving very rapidly and not stop).  You have real career goals and you've learned incredibly fast so far to get to where you are (right?).

The first part, adding value immediately, is more difficult -- that's where they want to see that you've had relevant experience before and can meet their technical bar.  There's a bit of a catch-22 with getting hired -- the easiest way to show you are employable is to have been employed before.  It's a check mark next to you.  So to cater to this, do whatever you can to show that other people have believed in you enough to use your work and skills.

Aside from those two characteristics, there is another major factor -- fit.  The hiring manager wants someone they and their team can work well with.  All the other stuff represents minimum hurdles for being considered.  But you often make or break your chances by being someone the team members want to know better and work with all day long.  Almost all hiring processes ask the full team to evaluate a late-stage candidate.

So to summarize, hiring managers are usually looking for 3 main things:

1. Capability
2. Motivation
3. Fit

You can learn a bit about the perspective of hiring managers by reading blog posts about how to hire developers.  No need to go crazy, but try to get a picture of why they're hiring you:

1. [The Best Way to Hire Software Developers](http://news.dice.com/2013/05/31/hiring-software-developers/)
2. [How to Hire Talent](http://lifeofaprogrammanager.blogspot.com/2006/06/how-to-hire-talent.html)
3. [Joel Spolsky has a lengthy diatribe on hiring developers](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FindingGreatDevelopers.html), which should give you an idea of the need and pain of hiring great engineers.
4. [Joel Spolsky's Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing 3](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html).  Look for "people who are 1. Smart, and 2. Get things done".

### Internships

A good way to start getting experience and show others that you're employable is to get an internship.  Just make sure it's a paid internship because no one values things they get for free.  You want the people you work with to value your contributions and feel like they have a stake in helping your succeed.  The good part is that internships tend to focus more on your growth potential than what you've done before, so you can start to avoid that chicken-and-egg problem described above.

## What You Can Do Beforehand (Way Beforehand)

Taking a structured approach to getting hired means starting early and getting some important things out of the way first.

### Get Good!

Navigating this process can be a beast but don't let it distract you from building your skills, which ultimately will determine if you get the job or not.

### Craft a Narrative

You may be uncomfortable "selling yourself" but that's exactly what you'll have to do.  Luckily, it's more subtle than you think -- it really means crafting a story about who you are, how you got to where you are, and why you'll keep growing.  Everyone can tell a story.  So put some effort into crafting a compelling narrative that stitches together your background (especially if you come from a non-traditional background) into a compelling an unavoidable wave of capability and drive.

* [How to Explain Your Career Transition by Dorie Clark](http://dorieclark.com/how-to-explain-your-career-transition/)

### Build a Portfolio

All along the way, you should keep building things.  The work you've done will be crucial to demonstrating your technical skill and getting hired.  Employers want to see that you can build and ship code and that you make good decisions when confronted with engineering trade-offs.  All of this stems from conversations about your portfolio of work.

The portfolio is also important for another thing that isn't mentioned much -- social proof.  If you've been a part of larger or group projects, that's almost like showing that you've worked somewhere before.  It make the employer comfortable that other people have worked with you before so they can too.

Your portfolio as a developer is Github.  You may have a personal website but Github is still the authoritative repository of your technical ability.  Ignore it at your peril.

* [A Programmer's Portfolio by Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/10/a-programmers-portfolio.html)
* [The Power of a Programming Portfolio by GrokCode](http://grokcode.com/58/the-power-of-a-programming-portfolio/)
* [Your Github Portfolio by Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/10/20/software-engineers-are-in-demand-and-github-is-how-you-find-them/)

### Prepare your Portfolio

build a port, clean up your github etc, 
schedule and strategize your time btw hiring and assets.  NETWORK WITH DEVS!!!

### Clean up your Web Presence (and Have One)

Google yourself in an incognito window (to avoid Google's smart algorithm).  What comes up? Do the links fit into your personal narrative?  Whoever is looking to hire you will certainly Google you.  Make sure that what they find matches what you want them to find.  If you've got a ridiculously common name, you may have a harder time building your web presence but it's also harder to have the *wrong* web presence.

The most important part of your web presence to fix up is your Github profile.  Make sure your projects are organized and their README files contain a description and a link to where it is live so anyone looking at the project can quickly see your brilliance.

Next, try to be discoverable.  If I'm trying to get in touch with your or find your work on the web, can I?  Do you have a personal website?  Are you on Twitter? You don't need to go crazy with social media, but sometimes just having enough of a profile to be a "real" person and give people the opportunity to get in touch with you can go a long way.  

Use LinkedIn if you're not allergic to it.  Again, this is about getting your personal narrative out there in the way YOU choose and not relying on Google to get it right.  LinkedIn is fast replacing the resume anyway.  

Other sites, like Brand Yourself below, will describe a bit better how to take on your web presence, but just make sure your narrative is being told the way you want it to.

* [Brand Yourself helps you... brand... yourself.  Basic services are free.](http://brandyourself.com)

* [How Important Is It for a Programmer to Have an Online Presence? on Stack Exchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/143673/how-important-is-it-for-a-programmer-to-have-an-online-presence)

### Project: Build your Personal Website

You don't need a personal website right off the bat but it's good to have and it's a fun project to test your skills with.  In the simplest case, it's a direct conduit to you for anyone searching and another way to craft your narrative.  It doesn't have to be elaborate at all.  If you hate writing, don't blog.  But you need to be a real person.  Showcase your work.  Geek out.

* [Why Every Job Seeker Should Have a Personal Website](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/26/why-every-job-seeker-should-have-a-personal-website-and-what-it-should-include/)

### Get Out in the Community and Collect Information

Find and meet other developers.  That doesn't mean "power networking" but it does mean genuine human connection.  Your network of people DOES matter in a BIG way.  For now, it's probably just for answering questions and harvesting advice but your next job will probably be found through the people you know and some who you meet while you're gathering this advice.  People like giving advice and like investing themselves emotionally in other people with growth curves.

That's best to do in person, where you can ask your dumb questions, but there are plenty of online communities as well, e.g. Meetups, Stack Overflow, Quora, local user groups...  Be a part of them and don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's a great way to build relationships.

You'll probably have a million questions but the relevant ones here are about understanding what exactly different jobs *are* and what they're looking for. The easiest way to find out is ask developers what they do.  It's much faster than trolling through blog posts trying to figure out the process.  Buy lunches and coffees if you must.  Set a goal of talking to 5 real human beings about your job search.

Another way to get this information is to check out a whole bunch of job postings.  You'll quickly start seeing similarities between them.  Yeah, it's shit work, but it must be done.  

Another facet of this is related to your web presence -- don't be afraid to produce content like blogging or answering questions on Quora.  They don't need to be explicitly technical, but should showcase your ability to think critically and write well.  Both of these play well with future employers.  


## Collect Leads 

You've moved beyond the preparation and knowledge gathering phase.  Now it's time to hit the pavement and approach the actual jobs.  

Organization is key here and a spreadsheet is highly recommended.  Keep track of not just the jobs themselves, but also their websites, any connections you have to the company, and a log of your activity.  Have a separate column for each "Must Have" criteria you identified in the earlier section (use a binary `true`/`false`) and each of the top 5 "Nice To Have" criteria (use a 3- or 5-point system) so you can quickly check off where the jobs rank.


in an organized way (spreadsheet?) and your connection to them.  Direct is better than monster.  SPAM FB friends.

### The Best Places to Look

Start with your network, even if it's small.  Reach out to your Facebook friends and friends-of-friends to see if anyone's hiring.  You should start your search with the highest probability / highest quality sources first:

1. Your network (including people you've met in the community)
2. Direct postings that go to a human (like when non-recruiters send emails out to the local Ruby list).  It's important to have another human being on the other end of the emails.
2. Direct postings (like on a company website for a specific position).  These will also usually go to a specific human being.
3. Job boards (pretty much awful, you're in the herd now)

Try checking out these links for job boards.  The more technically-focused, the better:

* [CWJobs](http://cwjobs.co.uk)
* [Github Jobs](https://jobs.github.com/)
* [White Truffle -- the Match.com of jobs. Weighted towards startups right now](http://www.whitetruffle.com)

### On Recruiters

good for knowns, less good for unknowns


## Qualify leads

Have your personal decision criteria figured out (remember it from earlier?).  Expected value weight everything if you can and rate it based on your criteria, including the non-negotiables.  Simpler is better.

* How easily can I continue to learn at that job?
* Is there access to mentors and teaching?
* How good are my peers who I can learn from?
* How much would I like going into work each day?
* What are the job-security risks of the job? Corporations aren't lock-tight just because they're big... they go through restructuring phases and lay off people with little good reason
* Does it pay well enough to support me?
* Does its location fit the needs of me and my family?
* How long do I want this (first) job for?


## Reaching Out and Applying

### Resume Versions

Tailor your resume for the type of opportunity.  Remember they can see the title.

### Cover Letters

Be concise, stick to your benefits, be human, feel their perspective, be specific

### Go in the Side Door

go in the side door! Get noticed!

### Applying

Track everything. Trickle it out there (when it rains it pours).

### Following up

Track everything.  Followup 3-7-14 days and be nice.


## Interviewing and Preparing to Interview

Interviewing terrifies people

### How the process works once you're in the funnel

Phone Screen, tech interview, tech challenge, fit, offer, negotiation, acceptance.

### The Phone Screen

Fit and minimum bar hurdle -- are you authentic?

### Preparing for the Phone Screen

Ask yourself the tough questions (like we did above)

### The Tech Interview

Be curious, be honest, be open minded

### The tech challenge

Examples of take-home tech challenges

### The "Fit" stuff

Fit is actually the most important thing (for better or worse)

## Handling an Offer

Compensation?  Negotiate.  Get THREE.

Companies will drag their feet because they can.  You will drag your feet too when you have multiple offer letters.  Don't take it personally but do what you can to fight it off when they do it.


## Alternate Paths

Do you not feel ready for work just yet?  Maybe you just skipped to this course and ignored the other ones.

### Bootcamps

_Perfect is the enemy of good - Voltaire._

Incidentally, you may be considering attending a full-time coding bootcamp to find a job. The majority of people shelling out money to attend a full-time coding bootcamp seeks to enhance their career prospects. Yes, there is a component of genuine interest and learning, but a clear expectation is that the programming courses offer an entry into a programming career. Some companies advertise 100% placement rate and six figure offers. How credible are these claims? Are such points relevant for your overall career search process?

If you're looking to be better informed about a full-time coding bootcamp and whether it might be useful to you, read this guide to help make your decision: [Choosing a Full-Time Coding Bootcamp](leanpub.com/choosing-programming-course)

One bootcamp we support (the founder here went through their program) is App Academy, which requires no tuition until you've found a dev job.  [If you use this link to apply, they've offered to help support The Odin Project!](http://www.appacademy.io/?referer=The+Odin+Project)  You should always make an informed decision, but that's our bias :)


## Contributing to The Odin Project and Other Open Source

We've talked a lot about how important it is to have a good portfolio of work and experience.  We've also talked about how helpful open source contributions are for this purpose.  Luckily for you, there's a growing movement to make open source projects more accessible for beginners and it starts with The Odin Project!  We run a team of volunteer developers using agile methodologies to work on our (open source) website.  [See our Getting Involved page for more information](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/blob/admin-flash/getting_involved.md).

Sam Joseph of HPU has also been facilitating a listing of more beginner friendly open source projects, particularly for non-profits.  You should be able to find other interesting projects to work on there.  More information about that project can be found at [AgileVentures.org](http://agileventures.org).
