# How do we Pair?

## Tools
For best pairing, we recommend using two very easy tools: [Skype](http://www.skype.com) and [Screenhero](http://www.screenhero.com). Skype lets you chat with other users for free. Screenhero is like Skype for screen sharing and lets you interact remotely with the other person's computer. Both tools are just one-click-to-call, and using them together will allow you to talk while you're working together on the same code on one of your computers... remotely!

Combining being able to talk with someone (over Skype) and being able to see and interact with the same computer (over Screenhero) is what makes pairing work.  

You could do it using just chat but it's not close to the same experience.  It's probably not necessary (and a waste of bandwidth) to have a video feed going at the same time either.

### Setting up Skype
Download the free client at [Skype.com](http://www.skype.com), set up your user details, and "call" your partner.

### Setting up ScreenHero
Setting up ScreenHero: Download the free client at [Screenhero.com](http://www.screenhero.com), set up your account, and "call" your partner to start sharing your screen and allowing your partner to interact with it.  You'll see two mice and you'll both be able to use your keyboards to interact with the shared computer.  Cool!

### Alternative Technologies (experimental)

Sometimes a program just won't work properly so you need to go to Plan B.  In our case, we usually recommend [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) because it has both audio and screensharing/remoting tools baked into one.  The bandwidth usage isn't quite as efficient as the Skype/Screenhero combination but should work fine for your purpose.  You'll need to sign up for Google Plus and add the extension to the Chrome browser to get it to work.

[This tutorial](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/google-in-the-enterprise/quick-tip-set-up-a-google-hangout-for-web-conferencing/2064) describes setting up a hangout session, though they don't get into the actual remote pairing side of things.  **Basically, just click [this link](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/) to open a new hangout once you've got the plugin installed.**

We'll be using the feature called Remote Desktop, which lets your partner use your computer like maybe you've experienced before with tech support.

Another alternative, as described in [this blog post](http://remotepairprogramming.com/post/43644506226/remote-pair-programming-technology), is Apple's native Screen Sharing app (combined with Skype).

Here's a [Google Hangout tutorial (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt_86-SrBX0) and another on [using Hangouts to screen share](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvpFsmcfz1k).  We will be using Remote Desktop Sharing so [check out this how-to video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XeCQrPZQ6Y) to familiarize yourself with it.

Do you have a favorite screensharing or remote pairing technology?  [Email us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) or [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), add your changes, then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Once you are able to talk to each other and you can both work on one of your screens, it's time to get coding!

## Techniques

There are a few different techniques for how to manage the actual process of pairing.  If you stick with Time Swapping and use an actual online timer, you can't go wrong.  It's the best defense against keyboard hogs.

* **Time swapping:** Spend 25 minutes as the driver, then swap roles. Try using a free online timer [like this one](http://tomato-timer.com/) set to 25 minutes.
* **Ping Pong:** If you're using a test-driven approach, one person writes the failing test then the other person makes it pass. Swap roles for the next test or batch of tests.

## Some tips:

* Think out loud as much as you can -- give each other a chance to hear your thoughts.
* No distractions! Emailing, texting, etc. should all be turned off while pairing.
* As navigator, wait 10 seconds before pointing out a typo... give the driver a chance to correct on their own

## After You've Finished

When you're done with your session, you've got code sitting on someone's computer that you'd both like to have.  If you're using git to save your work and push to a github repo, just make sure the repo is public and both of you will have access to it or be able to fork it as necessary (a good incentive to start using git...).

If you aren't using git yet, just have the student with the code on their hard drive email out the files or a .zip archive of them to make sure both people have it.
