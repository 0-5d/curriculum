# Pair Programming and Remote Pairing

## Intro

Pair programming isn't something that a lot of people have heard of before they get into development.  It certainly seems to counter the image of the rainmaker developer who hacks away on his own into the wee hours of the morning.  And for a long time, pairing was the domain of a dedicated but minority set of programmers who followed the [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)(XP for short) and similar agile methodologies for producing high quality code for clients.  The debate rages on about whether and how to use pairing for production code.  More recently, however, the power of pairing as purely a learning tool has been unlocked and it's much harder to argue against the benefits and evidence of its effectiveness for that purpose.

Pair programming is when two programmers work on the exact same code base.  Often, in the real world, it is done by simply passing the keyboard and mouse back and forth when it's time to switch.  Typically, one person (the "driver") writes the code while the other person (the "navigator") watches, thinks several steps ahead, and catches typos and bugs.  

In production settings, this results in better code and helps developers stay focused.  Despite tasking two developers to produce one code base, the gains in quality and speed make up for the loss of two separate producers.  But the two developers will also be constantly learning from each other, constantly thinking through problems together, and constantly staying engaged with the task at hand.  That means two developers pairing together can potentially learn many times faster and more effectively than they would on their own.  

This curriculum is designed specifically to benefit from and encourage the use of pair programming as a learning tool among peers.  The projects won't be easy and a single sneaky bug can frustrate you for hours on your own.  But with a pair, you're often able to get past the issue in a fraction of the time.  Any time when there's a lot of new stuff that needs learning to get a project to work, having a pair sitting either next to you or 1000 miles away using a screenshare can be invaluable. 

You'll end up working with a lot of different types of people, and sometimes it will go really well and other times you'll have to find patience.  But, overall, your learning experience will be greatly enriched by the chance to both learn from and teach to your peers along the way.

## Why Pair?

### Additional Resources
An older [writeup on pairing](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/pair.html) from Dr. Laurie Williams of NC State University has a rich bibliography of research on pairing.

## How do we Pair?

### Tools
For best pairing, we recommend using two very easy tools: Skype and Screenhero. Skype lets you chat with other users for free. Screenhero is like Skype for screen sharing. Both tools are just one-click-to-call, and using them together will allow you to talk while you're working together on the same code on one of your computers... remotely!

Setting up Skype: Download the free client at Skype.com, set up your user details, and "call" your partner.
Setting up ScreenHero: Download the free client at Screenhero.com, set up your account, and "call" your partner to start sharing your screen.
Once you are able to talk to each other and you can both work on one of your screens, it's time to get coding! There are a couple of approaches that work well, but they typically involve one person (the "driver") writing code while the other person (the "navigator") gives tactical guidance.
Time swapping: Spend 25 minutes as the driver, then swap roles. Try using a free online timer.
Ping Pong: If you're using a test-driven approach, one person writes the failing test then the other person makes it pass. Swap roles for the next test or batch of tests.
When you're done with your session, either share the github repo (if you're using a git workflow... please use a git workflow...) or email out the code to the partner whose computer hasn't been used.

### Techniques
Finally, some tips:

Think out loud as much as you can -- give each other a chance to hear your thoughts.
No distractions! Emailing, texting, etc. should all be turned off while pairing.
As navigator, wait 10 seconds before pointing out a typo... give the driver a chance to correct on their own
