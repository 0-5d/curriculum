# We need beta testers for JavaScript 101!

We are completely re-writing our JavaScript course from the ground up to bring it up to date and to make it as amazing as our Ruby and Rails courses have always been. As such, we need people to go through our new lessons and provide feedback. Anyone can help out, but what we're _really_ looking for are people who are relatively new to programming and are just starting to learn.

What we would love is for people to go through the lessons and then hang out in our chatrooms \(a great place to get help!\) asking literally _any_ questions they have about the lessons as they go.  By doing this we will be able to identify holes or weak spots in the lessons.  If we get several people that are confused about the same issues then we'll know we need to fix something.

In exchange for helping us out with this you'll get quite a bit of support in our chatrooms and in a new chatroom where you can get a little more personalized support as you go through the course.

We are pretty confident in our content, but it's hard to tell exactly how long it should take people to go through the course or if we've missed some small details along the way.
