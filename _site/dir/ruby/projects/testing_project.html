              <h1>Pair Project: Testing Ruby with RSpec</h1>

<p><em><a href="ruby.md">Return to Ruby</a></em></p>

<h2>Warmup: Time Traveling</h2>

<p>A good way to get familiar with and begin contributing to a new project is to write tests for it.  After the readings for this section, your head may be spinning a bit, so let's go back in time and write tests for some of the code you've already done.</p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<ol>
<li>Go back to the <a href="basic_ruby_project_2.md">Second Pair Project</a> and write tests for any 6 of the enumerable methods you wrote there.  In this case, identify several possible inputs for each of those functions and test to make sure that your implementation of them actually makes the tests pass.  Be sure to try and cover some of the odd edge cases where you can.</li>
<li><p>Write tests for your Tic Tac Toe project.  In this situation, it's not quite as simple as just coming up with inputs and making sure the method returns the correct thing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start by writing tests to make sure a player wins when he or she should, e.g. when the board reads X X X across the top row, your game-over should be triggered.</li>
<li>Test each of your main methods to make sure they function properly and handle edge cases.</li>
<li>Try using mocks/doubles to isolate methods and make sure that they're sending you back the right outputs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Project: TDD Connect Four</h2>

<p>Hopefully everyone has played Connect Four at some point (if not, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Wikipedia page</a>).  It's a basic game where each player drops pieces into the cage in turn.  A player wins if he or she manages to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.</p>

<p>The game rules are fairly straightforward and you'll be building it on the command line like you did with the other games.  If you want to spice up your game pieces, look up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Miscellaneous_Symbols">unicode miscellaneous symbols</a>.  The Ruby part of this should be well within your capability by now so it shouldn't tax you much to think about it.</p>

<p>The major difference here is that you'll be doing this TDD-style.  So figure out what needs to happen, write a (failing) test for it, then write the code to make that test pass, then see if there's anything you can do to refactor your code and make it better.</p>

<p>Only write exactly enough code to make your test pass.  Oftentimes, you'll end up having to write two tests in order to make a method do anything useful.  That's okay here.  It may feel a bit like overkill, but that's the point of the exercise.  Your thoughts will probably be something like "Okay, I need to make this thing happen.  How do I test it?  Okay, wrote the test, how do I code it into Ruby?  Okay, wrote the Ruby, how can I make this better?"  You'll find yourself spending a fair bit of time Googling and trying to figure out exactly how to test a particular bit of functionality.  That's also okay... You're really learning RSpec here, not Ruby, and it takes some getting used to.</p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<ol>
<li>Build Connect Four!  Just be sure to keep it TDD.</li>
