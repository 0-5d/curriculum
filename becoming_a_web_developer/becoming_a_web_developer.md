# Becoming a Web Developer

## Intro

This short section is about answering the basic questions people have about the actual practice and career of web development.  Because, let's be honest, even if you've got a strong feeling that you like building things and web development is the right path for you, you still probably don't have a great idea of what developers actually do... and that's where everyone starts so it's okay.

If some of the terms and explanations here seem unfamiliar to you, it may be worth checking out the next section on [web development basics](/web_development_basics/web_development_basics.md) and coming back here as necessary.

## So What Does a Web Developer Actually Do?

The short answer... they build and maintain websites.  But what exactly that looks like varies widely depending on the type of job the developer works at. The good part is that web developers are in high demand and so, though they work very hard, they're generally able to command comfortable salaries and healthy work/life balances.  It's a profession that rewards people who are natural problem solvers and who enjoy building things.

Often, the developer is working on behalf of clients who are trying to get their product or service out onto the web.

A more detailed explanation, from http://degreedirectory.org/articles/What_Does_a_Web_Developer_Do.html:

<blockquote>
Web Developer Job Duties

Your job as a Web developer is to present your clients' products and services to a wide audience by creating attractive, functional websites. You will likely be asked to identify potential site users and design a website to appeal to these constituents. Your work may include meeting with clients to discuss their desires for a website or discuss how to keep their website functioning and up to date. You might construct the layout of a website, creating a visually interesting home page and user-friendly design. You may also write the content for the website.

After a website is up and running, you'll make sure that the site is functional on all Web browsers, periodically testing and updating it as needed. A client may also need you to include interactive capabilities on their site using Visual Basic or Java programming languages.

Where You Work

Web developers may work for large corporations, small companies or as freelancers. Most positions will have you working 40 hours a week, while others - especially freelance positions - enjoy flexible schedules. Occasionally, you may be required to work during the weekend or other non-standard business hours in order to perform website maintenance or in the case of an emergency.

Other Skills
You need to have a familiarity with technology and understand how computers and web servers operate. You will also need to be familiar with many software programs, Web applications and Web programming languages, such as hypertext markup language (HTML), Ruby on Rails and C++. Since this is a very client-based, project-oriented field, you must be able to communicate effectively, set goals and meet deadlines. You must also be creative and have a grasp of art and design principles.

##### The key take-aways here are:
* Developers often work on behalf of clients who are trying to get their product or service out onto the web.  
* The work is typically very project-focused and involves working with a team of people who help coordinate the client's needs with the end product.
* Not all devs work for external clients... The "client" could just be your tech company, organization, government etc. who need a website or web application built

##### Important Distinctions

**Front End vs Back End Developers**

*"Front End" typically refers to the stuff that you actually see on the website in the browser.  This covers how the content is presented including all the little user interface elements like menus and dropdowns and transitions and modals.  A front end developer will often focus heavily on understanding HTML, CSS, and Javascript since these languages live in the browser.  They aren't necessarily focused on making things look "pretty", but rather making sure that the information is presented effectively and the user's interaction with the web page is as smooth as possible.  These days we're doing more and more coding in the browser itself.

*"Back End" typically refers to the guts of the application which live on the server.  The back end is more focused on making sure all the data gets sent out properly to the browser.  It's the portion of iceberg below the surface... lots of stuff needs to go right to hand off data to the front end so it can be displayed.  Google may be a relatively straightforward search engine from our point of view, but they employ thousands of engineers to make sure that all the moving parts you don't see are working properly.

*"Full Stack" developers marry the two sides into one.  While each "end" involves learning a significant amount of information, a full stack developer can comfortably speak both database and browser.  These days the trend is to seek developers with a great working knowledge of both ends (which is what we're teaching here).

**Web Developer vs Web Designer**

*So, if we've got back end developers and front end developers, who makes the website actually look pretty?  Who pulls together the images and logos and color schemes?  That's the web designer's job.  They are typically less inclined to handle the actual coding of the page.

## Sounds Good... So How Can I Get a Job?

The best thing you can do in order to get a job as a web developer is, of course, to know your stuff!  But, when compared to other careers, web development does have some wrinkles (that probably work in your favor).  Because the industry has a long history of successful developers with varying backgrounds, people tend to care more about what you've actually **built** than how you got there (e.g. which school you went to).  Interviews are typically a combination of testing your ability to think technically (with thought questions, brain teasers, coding exercises) and an examination of the work you've done previously.  They are usually looking for people with a demonstrated ability to pick things up quickly, complete projects, and work well with others.
