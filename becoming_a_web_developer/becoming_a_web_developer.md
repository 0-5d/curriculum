# Becoming a Web Developer

## Intro

This module is about answering the basic questions people have about the actual practice and career of web development.  Because, let's be honest, even if you've got a great feeling that you like building things and web development is the right path for you, you still probably don't have a great idea of what developers actually do... and that's where everyone starts so it's okay.

If some of the terms and explanations here seem unfamiliar to you, it may be worth checking out the next section on [web development basics](web_development_basics/web_development_basics.md) and coming back here as necessary.

## So How Can I Get a Job?

The best thing you can do in order to get a job as a web developer is, of course, to know your stuff!  But, when compared to other careers, web development does have some wrinkles (that probably work in your favor).  Because the industry has a long history of successful developers with varying backgrounds, people tend to care more about what you've actually **built** than how you got there (e.g. which school you went to).  Interviews are typically a combination of testing your ability to think technically (with thought questions, brain teasers, coding exercises) and an examination of the work you've done previously.
