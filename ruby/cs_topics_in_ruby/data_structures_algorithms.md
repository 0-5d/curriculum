# Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

The basic idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application.  You can usually store data in one giant array, but it can be very time consuming to locate a particular value.  Depending on the application, there are a batch of other basic data structures that you can use to meet your needs.  Often, you end up making trade-offs between various attributes like how long it takes to first populate the structure, how long it takes to add or find elements, and how large the structure is in memory.

We'll get more into the specifics of data structures later in the curriculum, but this introduction should again expand your toolbox slightly so you're much better able to identify and solve certain problems where Arrays, Hashes and Sets don't quite cut it.  This is particularly relevant when you're trying to search through a bunch of data for a particular value or plan out a strategy several moves in advance.

Some problems, like traversing a tree looking for a certain element, are relatively common in data intensive applications and have been solved many times in the past.  Understanding how they are solved will give you some great tools to apply to other (similar) problems as well.  Algorithms are really just ways of solving problems (like this) systematically.  You'll learn about some of the common algorithms like breadth-first-search and depth-first-search.


## Homework Assignment

1. Glance over the [Wikipedia entry on Data Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) for a high level overview of things.
2. Learn about Queues and Stacks by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QS_Cup1YoI)
2. Learn about binary search trees by watching [this video](http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/binary_search/binary_search-720p.mp4) from Harvard's CS50x on edX.
3. Read [this Quora question about the importance of algorithms in web development](http://www.quora.com/Algorithms/What-is-the-importance-of-algorithms-in-web-development) to get some context for why we're going over this stuff.
1. Learn about basic algorithms from Coursera's Algorithms course in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2TwK3fED8A).  The first 10 minutes are really the meat of the introduction to algorithms, the rest gets more mathematical (if you're so inclined).  
2. Read the [Gentle Introduction to Algorithms for Web Developers](http://www.giocc.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-algorithms-for-web-developers.html) for another basic look at what algorithms are.
3. Finally, learn about Depth First Search and Breadth First Search from [this video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZhSSXAwxI).

## Test Yourself
* Breadth First Search is best used when you want to find the **shortest** path to something but it can take a very long time
* Depth first search is best used when you want to find any path to a solution but find it fast.
