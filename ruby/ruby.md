## Intro

In this unit you will learn Ruby, the language designed specifically with programmer happiness in mind.  It's a healthy chunk of learning but, by the end of it all, you'll have built some pretty sweet games including Tic Tac Toe, Minesweeper, Checkers, and Chess.  You'll be able to put together a Twitter spambot (that really spams!), save and open files, test out your code, separate your spaghetti code into nice modular classes, and even reproduce some basic algorithms and data structures for solving complex problems.  Basically, you're going to start feeling a whole lot more like a real programmer and that feeling will be justified.

Some people believe you can just dive right into Rails and start firing out websites.  Rails is a framework built using Ruby and every piece of code in it is Ruby.  When (not *if*) something in your project breaks, you'd better be able to debug it.  And what happens when you want to stretch your wings and do something just a bit beyond what the vanilla tutorials show you how to do?  The amount of time you'd spend googling your error messages and staring blankly at help docs was better spent learning Ruby.

As you may gather, this is also where the real project work begins.  Some of the early material will be fairly straightforward and will rely on simple exercises to help reinforce understanding.  We'll learn using some Codecademy modules at first but the goal is for you to get a much deeper and more practical understanding of the material than that.  As we get further along and into some of the more advanced topics, we'll be learning less and doing more... just the way it should be.   Buckle up, strap in, and let's get learning!

**How this will work:**

Ruby's a big language so it's been broken up into smaller chunks to make it more digesible.  In each section, you'll first be asked to do readings, watch videos, or otherwise view content.  We'll provide a "A Brief Summary" of the material but it's not a replacement for actually doing the reading/pre-work.  Consider the summary more like if you come home from school and ask your older brother to explain some tricky points from your math class to you in layman's terms.  At the end of each section there will be exercises to help you solidify your knowledge of the material and after each group of sections will be larger projects which are best done in pairs.

**Our free resources:**

The goal here is to provide as much of this curriculum as possible using free resources.  If you've done the prep work from Web Development 101 then you should have a good handle on the basics but these resources are important to help you really understand the material.
* The staple online book: Zed Shaw's [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/), an extension of his wildly popular Learn Python the Hard Way into Ruby.
* Another good online resource is [Zetcode's Ruby Tutorial](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/).  It can get a bit technical at times but bear with it.
* For the crazies: Why's [Poignant Guide to Programming](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-1.html) (check it out... if it jives with your learning style, you may have found the match you never thought you'd find)
* If there's anything you need to brush up on still: [The Ruby User's Guide](http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/) has sections on many topics you might want to dive back into for a deeper look.

**Other great resources that aren't free:**
* Peter Cooper's [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) is a solid introduction to Ruby that covers pretty much the breadth of the language as you need to understand it.
* Brian Marick's [Everyday Scripting with Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/bmsft/everyday-scripting-with-ruby) takes a pragmatic approach to learning Ruby to help with the kinds of problems you might face in a variety of different real-world work scenarios.
