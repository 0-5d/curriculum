# Solving Problems with Ruby

*[Top level table of contents](/README.md)*

*[Ruby table of contents](/ruby/ruby.md#table-of-contents)*

## Intro

You've mastered the very basics of Ruby and had the chance to write script files filled with methods.  It didn't even take that long! You can already do plenty of useful things with just that knowledge but, in order to create scripts to solve more complex problems, you'll need to take the next step forward and learn some additional stuff.

If you have a bigger problem to solve, how do you figure out what to put into your methods? When should you use classes instead?  How should you organize your code and make it not look completely amateurish?  What is the best way to first tackle that new problem and start writing Ruby to solve it?  What's the most efficient way to debug errors?

This section will answer those questions and more.  You'll start working on some more interesting coding projects as well (games!).  By the end, you should feel much more comfortable taking a new challenge and converting it into elegant, useful Ruby.  Your methods should start to feel cleaner, simpler, and better organized.  You'll still probably scratch your head and wonder if your code is really any good but it will get better with every new project you do.


## Roadmap
2. [Classes and Modules](classes.md)
7. [Scope and Inheritance](scope.md)
4. [Designing Good Code](design.md)
3. [Good Style](style.md)
5. [Debugging Your Code](debugging.md)
6. [Refactoring your Code](refactoring.md)
8. [Recursion](recursion.md)
9. [Additional Topics](additional-topics.md)
9. [PROJECT](basic_ruby_project_1.md)(~6 hours)


## Finish

You've built actual games that you can play with your friends (albeit from the command line) and we're barely getting into this stuff.  In the following sections, we'll get into some of the more formal Computer Science ways of solving complex problems before venturing out into the World Wide Web to let you unleash your Ruby powers on the unsuspecting Internet.
