## Test Yourself

Make sure you can do the [Beginner Ruby Quiz #2](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/76), [Quiz #3](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/77), [Quiz #4](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/78), and [Quiz #6](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/80) from [Code Quizzes](http://www.codequizzes.com/).  They're pretty quick and should give you an idea of what you still need to brush up on.
