# Basic Ruby

## Intro

Ruby shouldn't be anything new to you by now... you should have completed the preparatory readings, Ruby Monk, and the test-first exercises as part of the [Ruby 101 section of the Web Development 101 Unit](/web_development_basics/web_development_basics.md#ruby-101) that you completed prior to jumping into this.  If you haven't, go back and work on that before getting started here.  It's expected that you have a pretty good handle on the basics of the Ruby language and an idea of what you're still shaky on.  You may have felt like you were drinking from a fire hose the first time around, but some of it should have stuck.

In this section on Basic Ruby, we're going to make sure you really do understand all the building blocks of the language and of programming in general.  It's a lot of stuff... this section is going to have the most to absorb right off the bat.  That's because you first need to populate your developer's toolkit before we can build things.  Luckily, much of it will expand on familiar territory.  We'll start in Part I with basic data types and, in Part II, we'll journey through flow control, iteration, blocks and enumerable methods.  

At the end of each section there will be exercises that you should do on your own.  They won't take too long if you understand the material well.  After each part will be a project.  We recommend that you pair up with someone else to work on those because that's the best way to learn.

If there's something that you still just don't quite understand, track it down via the Additional Resources section or Google for it on your own.  *How* you learn isn't as important as making sure you're comfortable with your understanding of everything that will be covered here.

## Finish
You should already feel pretty good about your ability to use Ruby to solve problems and create small methods to do things.  And we've barely scratched the surface!  You're still probably a bit shakey on how to organize your code and what exactly is going on at a higher level.  

The Intermediate Ruby section (next!) will dive more into those types of issues so you'll feel confident building little programs to solve problems.  Then we keep going into using Ruby on the web, testing, and more.  Forward!!!

##### Exercises (Paired)
* Rewrite the following methods from Enumerable.  You may not use the real method... which should be obvious.  You MAY use #each in the following methods once you've created it yourself the first time:
    * #each
    * #each_with_index
    * #map
    * #select
