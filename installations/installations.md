# Installations

## Intro

One step which can be unnecessarily frustrating is making sure everything is installed on your computer to work properly.  Just about every recent beginner has some horror story about how long they battled with their computer and Google to finally get their environment working properly.  And often you hear it used as a reason why it took people so long to get started in the first place.

One option for learning development has always been to use an existing online environment.  In fact, almost all sites geared towards beginners these days encourage you to use their platform, where you type in some code and it will execute it for you.  Magic! Frankly, we think that's a wholly incomplete approach.  What happens when you want to actually build something on your own?  

If you're interested in being at least a half-serious web developer you'll need to get this stuff up and running on your machine at some point and it's best to get it done early.  This brief unit is devoted solely to helping you install what you need to install.  

Final note to Windows users -- you can do everything you need to do but you'll feel at times like you're swimming against the current.  Many examples throughout the learning process will assume you're working on a mac and you'll have to get good at translating certain steps into your own workflow.  Suffering builds character.  And this is payback for the 90's when it took another six months to come out with a Mac version of any half-decent game.
