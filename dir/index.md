# Welcome!

If you're looking to learn web development you've come to the right place! 

There are tons of free resources online but where do you find them?  Which ones should you do first?  People always say "build projects"... what are the best projects to build?  Who can you work with or ask questions of when you get stuck?

This project was born out of a desire to make it much easier to chart a path through all that content and also to find people to work with along the way.  The curriculum and other tools are totally free and the source code for everything is available on Github, so enjoy!

If this is your first time here, have a look around and check out the "Getting Started" link on the left for a more complete introduction to the project.

Good luck and happy coding!
