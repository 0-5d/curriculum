### Good Programming with OOP

#### Intro

You've got the building blocks of Ruby out of the way, great! Now it's time to get into the fun stuff... how do we combine those building blocks in the most efficient and elegant ways to produce the programs we'd like to write?

The concepts you'll learn here are often less specific to Ruby itself and more widely applicable to any object-oriented language.  That's because the fundamental concepts are just that... fundamental.  Don't repeat yourself.  Modularize your code.  Have your classes and methods only do one thing.  Show as little of your interfaces to the world as you can.  Don't make methods or classes heavily dependent on each other.  Be lazy.  These will take some time and practice to implement effectively, but you'll already be taking a big step towards creating high quality code just by finishing up this section.

There's a lot to do here but stick with it!  The Codecademy lessons are interspersed with their projects.  The Beginning Ruby book will help you understand the material a bit deeper, which will be important to understand for creating your own projects.

#### Homework Assignment

1. Do [Codecademy Ruby sections 7, 9, and 10](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby):
  
    1. [Refactoring](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-1o8Mb?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)
    2. [Project: The Refactor Factory](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-Zjd2y?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)
    3. [Object-Oriented Programming, Part I](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-MFiQ6?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)
    4. [Project: Virtual Computer](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-X5wcR?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)
    5. [Object-Oriented Programming, Part II](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-zfe3o?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)
    6. [Project: Banking on Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-32cN3?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)

2. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 5: `The Ruby Ecosystem` for a brief break from code to learn more about the world of Ruby.
3. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 6: `Classes, Objects, and Modules`.  It will extend your knowledge deeper than Codecademy alone.
4. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 7: `Projects and Libraries`
5. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 8: `Documentation and Error Handling` but skip the stuff on Testing (pgs 190-196)
6. Glance over the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) so you have an idea of how to make your code look more professional.

#### Test Yourself

Make sure you can do [Quiz #5](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/79) and [Quiz #7](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/81) from [Code Quizzes](http://www.codequizzes.com).  

Then do their [Practical Object Oriented Design Quiz](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/1/quizzes/40), which will delve deeper into design principles.  There are some new concepts here to pick up as well.
