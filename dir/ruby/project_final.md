# Project: Testing Ruby with RSpec
Estimated Time: 12-18 hours

## Final Project: Chess

You've come a long way.  Now it's time to prove how much you know.  

Chess is a classic game that appears very complicated at first but can be broken down into logical steps that make it a great Ruby capstone project.  If you've never played, be sure to read up on the rules (see the [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)) first.

The problem specification is deliberately sparse for this -- it's up to you to attack the problem with very little prior information or structure... it's good practice for real world programming challenges.


### Your Task

1. Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.
2. Write tests for the important parts.  You don't need to TDD it (unless you want to), but be sure to use RSpec tests for anything that you find yourself typing into the command line repeatedly.
3. Do your best to keep your classes modular and clean and your methods doing only one thing each.  This is the largest program that you've written, so you'll definitely start to see the benefits of good organization (and testing) when you start running into bugs.
4. Have fun!  Check out the [unicode characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode) for a little spice for your gameboard.
