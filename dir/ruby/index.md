# Ruby
Total Estimated Time: 100-200 hours

## Intro

In this unit you will learn Ruby, the language designed specifically with programmer happiness in mind.  It's a healthy chunk of learning but, by the end of it all, you'll have built some pretty sweet projects including Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, a real web server, and even Chess.  You'll be able to put together a Twitter spambot (that really spams!), save and open files, test out your code, separate your spaghetti code into nice modular classes, and even reproduce some basic algorithms and data structures for solving complex problems.  Basically, you're going to start feeling a whole lot more like a real programmer and that feeling will be justified.

Some people believe you can just dive right into Rails and start firing out websites.  Rails is a framework built using Ruby and every piece of code in it is Ruby.  When (not *if*) something in your project breaks, you'd better be able to debug it.  And what happens when you want to stretch your wings and do something just a bit beyond what the vanilla tutorials show you how to do?  The amount of time you'd spend googling your error messages and staring blankly at help docs was better spent learning Ruby.

As you may gather, this is also where the real project work begins.  Some of the early material will be fairly straightforward and will rely on simple exercises to help reinforce understanding.  We'll learn using some Codecademy modules at first but the goal is for you to get a much deeper and more practical understanding of the material than that.  As we get further along and into some of the more advanced topics, we'll be learning less and doing more... just the way it should be.   Buckle up, strap in, and let's get learning!

#### How this will work:

Ruby's a big language so it's been broken up into smaller chunks to make it more digesible.  In each section, you'll first be asked to do readings, watch videos, or otherwise view content.  At the end of each section there will be exercises to help you solidify your knowledge of the material and after each group of sections will be larger projects which are best done in pairs.

#### Two Paths Forward:

Everyone is coming into this with a different goal in mind, so to accomodate that, here's two options for your path forward:  
1. If you're just trying to race ahead and put up some Rails sites as fast as possible and worry about learning the fundamentals later, then your best bet is to complete the Basic Ruby section, which uses primarily Codecademy as a resource, and move onto the Rails unit.
2. If you're really looking for a solid, sustainable base of knowledge, just stick to the normal roadmap and we'll get you there.

##### Our Primary "Textbooks":

1. [Codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) has a lot of great introductory content to get you ramped into the Ruby language.  You've already read [Chris Pine's Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) in the Web Development 101 section for a good introduction, and the Codecademy stuff will overlap a bit and carry forward from there.
2. Peter Cooper's [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) is a solid introduction to Ruby that covers pretty much the breadth of the language as you need to understand it.  It's a bit outdated but Ruby hasn't changed a whole lot since then.  The goal of this project is to move BEYOND Codecademy and other simple, free resources and get you building stuff on your own.  This book will start covering some of the more intermediate/useful stuff that you'll need to know to do that.

It is not free -- usually somewhere around $30-40, but, as [Peter said himself](http://beginningruby.org/):

> Now, of course, I can’t actively participate in pirating my book but, heck, it’s around on plenty of “free e-book” sites and on RapidShare. There are even links on Twitter to torrents like [this](http://www.torrentdownloads.net/torrent/1650632409/Apress+Beginning+Ruby+From+Novice+to+Professional+2nd+Edition+Jul+2009+eBook-BBL). I am happy for you to pirate my book, but.. I’m NOT A LAWYER, and I can’t guarantee what Apress would do about it – so you’d be doing it off your own back! So, uhm, don’t pirate it? ;-) The only condition, of course, if you do is that if you like the book and you think a print copy would be swell to own, please buy one – even if it’s just for someone you know who wants to learn to program!


##### The (Free) Backup "Textbooks":

Some things you just won't pick up right away or their coverage by main resources will fall short of your expectations.  Luckily there are lots of options for places to shore up your understanding:

1. The staple online book: Zed Shaw's [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/), an extension of his wildly popular Learn Python the Hard Way into Ruby.
2. The other good book, available in the older edition online for free: [The "Pickaxe", or Programming Ruby 3rd Edition](http://it-ebooks.info/book/59/)
