# Project: Recursion
Estimated Time: 3-4 hours

## Warmup: Fibonnacci

The [Fibonacci Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

### Your Task

1. Write a method `fibs` which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence.  Use iteration for this solution.
2. Now write another method `fibs_rec` which solves the same problem recursively.  This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you're crazy).


### Student Solutions

*Send us your solution so we can show others! Submit a link to the Github repo with your files in it here using any of the methods listed on the [contributing page](/contributing.md).  Please include your partner's github handle somewhere in the description if they would like attribution.*

## Project: Merge Sort

We spent some time early on dealing with sorting (e.g. bubble sort).  Now it's time to take another look at sorting with [Merge Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort), a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets.

### Background Viewing

1. Check out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQ8pwjQxTM) from Harvard's CS50x course.

### Your Task

1. Build a method `merge_sort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.  Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
