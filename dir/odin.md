# Odin

Odin is a figure from Norse mythology, the allfather of the gods.  He is powerful and fickle (as they often are) but also wise and cunning.  His search for knowledge is a thing of legends -- [he gave his eye for the wisdom of ages](http://norse-mythology.org/tales/why-odin-is-one-eyed/) and [hung from the world tree, pierced by his own spear, for nine days and nights to gain the knowledge of runes](http://norse-mythology.org/tales/odins-discovery-of-the-runes/).

Learning development is not an easy task and the tools laid out here are merely the path; you must walk it yourself.  Should you possess a thirst for knowledge and persistence of spirit akin to that storied in Odin's mythos, you will surely find success on your journey.
