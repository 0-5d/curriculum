# A Sample Remote Pairing Session

If all of that seemed a bit confusing, here's a step-by-step workflow for remote pairing.

1. Find and call your partner on Skype
1. Find and "call" your partner on Screenhero and share your screen
1. Get your [pomodoro timer](http://tomato-timer.com/) fired up
1. Come up with your battle plan for the project
1. [If using git] Create the public Github repo for the project
1. Code! Switch! Code! Switch! Repeat n times!
1. Push your code to the Github repository or email it to the partner whose computer wasn't used
1. Schedule another session!
