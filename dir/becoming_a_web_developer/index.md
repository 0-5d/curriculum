# Becoming a Web Developer
Total estimated time: 2-4 hours

This short section is about answering the basic questions people have about the actual practice and career of web development.  Because, let's be honest, even if you've got a strong feeling that you like building things and web development is the right path for you, you still probably don't have a great idea of what developers actually do... and that's where everyone starts so it's okay.

If some of the terms and explanations here seem unfamiliar to you, it may be worth checking out the section on [web development 101](/web_development_basics/web_development_basics.md) and coming back here as necessary.  Hopefully, you'll be interested enough in this stuff to go check it out afterward!

Start with [code.org's video about "what most schools don't teach"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) to get fired up.
