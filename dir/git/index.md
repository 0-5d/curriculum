## Intro

Hopefully you've been using the basic Git commands to create repositories and push your code up to Github.  If not, you've got a bit of catching up to do but don't worry.
 
In any case, Git is a crucial skill to have whether you're a professional web developer or just a hobbyist who needs to back up the code base.  It's the "save" button on steroids for code and it allows giant teams of developers to collaborate.  There really aren't all that many commands for you to learn, either, but sometimes the real difficulty of it comes from visualizing in your head what it's actually doing.

In this section, we'll dive deeper than just the `$ git pull` and `$ git add .` commands you've been using.  Maybe you've had the dubious pleasure of getting a merge conflict when you tried to pull or push changes.  Maybe you're just curious how multiple developers can work on a single code base at the same time.  Either way, this section should help you take the first steps towards expanding your git toolkit and understanding what's actually going on under the hood with git.
