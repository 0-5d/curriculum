# Project: Databases and SQL

It's tough to read a bunch of stuff and then "know" how to build good queries.  In the end, it comes down to a conceptual understanding of how the pieces fit together -- can you visualize what's happening when two tables are joined?  The best way to acquire this is practice.  Break out a pen and paper and write down what you think is going on.

## Quick Quiz

This quiz shouldn't take long at all, but if you didn't score better than a 17/20, you should consider rereading some of the material.

## Project: SQL Zoo

## Your Task

In this project, you'll use the SQLZoo website to practice writing SQL queries.  Some of them will be easy, others will be quite difficult.

## Roadmap:

* Overview of databases (should be review from 101 section)
* SQL online resources
* Advanced: the whole coursera course on databases
* Easy quiz: http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=SQL
* Project: SQL Zoo
