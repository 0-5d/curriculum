##### Rails Mini Project:
Estimated Time: 3-5 hrs

<a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/scheduler?cb=5" target="_blank" title="Pair using the Scheduler">Pair on this project!</a>

* Do the [Jumpstart Labs Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).

**Extra Credit:** Michael Hartl guides you through [creating a sample app using scaffolding](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top) as the first stage of his Rails tutorial.  Just do chapter 2 -- you'll be doing the rest of the tutorial anyway later on during the Rails unit.  If you aren't comfortable with git, either do the section below on git (under the "Additional Topics" heading) or skip any of the `$ git ... ` commands for now, they're non-essential (it's sort of like saving your files on Dropbox).
