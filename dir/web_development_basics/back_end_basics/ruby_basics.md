#### Ruby 101
Estimated Time: 20-30 hrs

##### You Will Need to Understand:
* What is an "interpreted" language?
* What is IRB?
* What are Objects?
* What are Methods?
* What are Classes?
* What are Blocks?
* What is an Array?
* What is an Iterator?
* What are hashes?
* What is a library?
* What is a gem?


Our back end focus will be on Ruby, the language designed for programmer happiness.  What takes dozens of lines of code in Java or a hundred in C could take just a couple in Ruby because it prepackages lots of sneaky functions into easy-to-use convenience methods.  It has occasionally been criticized for not running as fast as some of the other languages, but that's not so much an issue when you can just load more servers/instances running your web application.  Being able to write code faster and with less headache allow you to iterate frequently when building a website and so the end product is more likely to suit the client or the user's needs.

Ruby is pretty darn close to Python.  In some ways, they sort of resemble romance languages -- once you've learned one, it's not terribly hard to pick up another because they tend to follow many of the same conventions, just using different "words".  Python tends to be taught more in colleges and is used a fair bit for more data-intensive applications.  But Ruby has a secret weapon that makes it the love of fast-iterating website producers -- the framework Ruby on Rails (which we'll cover in the next section on Frameworks).

With either of the languages, there are a couple of things that aren't immediately intuitive but become very useful when you understand them.  We'll do a healthy introduction to Ruby here and then, in the unit on Ruby, you'll get to understand it like the back of your hand.

A final note -- you'll be learning a bunch of new terminology and concepts here but don't think they're only applicable to Ruby.  Most of it (like methods, classes, objects etc.) will pop up again in Javascript and pretty much any other language you pick up.

##### Assignment:
1. Go to [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org) and do the quick exercises there to get your feet wet.  Don't worry about the stuff where they're reading from a file, that's getting deeper than you need to right now.
2. Read through the [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) project from Jumpstart Labs.  If you can't get IRB running, check out the [Installation Unit](/installations), which you should have done already.
3. Dive in a little deeper by reading chapters 1-10 of Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=00).  Try to do the exercises at the end of each chapter.  Take a crack at chapter 10, but don't feel disheartened if it still doesn't click for you.
4. Finally, conquer the [Ruby Monk's Introduction to Ruby](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1).  If you're shaky on Hashes, Blocks, Modules, and I/O... you're not the first and won't be the last so have no fear.  We'll dive deeply into those in the coming units.

**Bonus:**

Redo the same Project Euler problems that you previously did in Javascript but using Ruby instead (try using IRB or a .rb file that you run from the command line):

1. [Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
2. [Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers](http://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
3. [Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor](http://projecteuler.net/problem=3) (remember, don't bother for anything over 100,000 doing the brute force solution or you'll need a few days to calculate...)
