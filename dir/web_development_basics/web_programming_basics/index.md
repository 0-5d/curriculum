## Web Programming Basics
Estimated Time: 40-60 hrs

Many of the things we're about to cover will be handled in much greater depth later on in the curriculum but it's important to get a basic level understanding of what they are and how they're used so you can still see the bigger picture while you're down in the weeds learning that stuff.  Take the time to get to know each of the major building blocks of a web application, from the front end to the back end and into databases.  And just because we're covering a lot of material doesn't mean we're not learning anything well -- you'll be spending a good bit of time becoming familiar with the "101" level of each technology (each section may take 5-10 hrs to complete fully).

We will cover Front End Basics and Back End Basics.
