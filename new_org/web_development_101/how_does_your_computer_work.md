# Step Back... How Does Your Computer Work?
Estimated Time: 2-4 hrs

This isn't a course about rebuilding your hard drive but it is useful for you to understand the high level overview of what's going on to make your computer function.  That's partly because you'll see the same patterns showing up when you're telling servers what to do and partly because you're going to have to talk to your computer in a way that it understands anyway so you'd better speak a little of its language.

### Assignment:
1. Spare 15 minutes to [learn how computers work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIDzNyfVVg0).


## The Command Line

Raise your hand if you're scared of the command line.  Yes, we have this image of developers staring at a black screen with white or green text flashing across while they wildly enter incomprehensible commands and hack into the corporate mainframe (spilling soda and wiping cheetos off their keyboard no doubt as well).

That black screen (or window) is the command line, where you're able to enter commands that your computer will run for you.  And while that image of a programmer is a bit overdone, the command line really is sort of like our base of operations, from which we'll launch other programs to do our "real developing" in.  It has a syntax of its own which is different but not all that difficult to pick up.  You'll be entering the same commands dozens of times anyway, so you'll get pretty good at it in a short period of time.

### Assignment:
1. To gain a better understanding of your command line, take this [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw.  It can be a bit rough at times because the explanations are a bit sparse, so don't worry if you don't absorb it all the first time.  You'll get quite familiar with the few commands that you end up using every day over the course of the next few weeks anyway.
