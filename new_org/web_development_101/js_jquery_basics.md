# Javascript and jQuery 101
Estimated Time: 15-20 hrs

## You Will Need To Understand:
* What is a scripting language?
* What is a variable?
* What is a string? An array? A boolean?
* What is the DOM?
* How can you interact with the DOM?
* What are events?
* How can you add elements to the DOM?


## Javascript:
As we [saw before](http://www.skillcrush.com/terms/javascript.html), Javascript is the in-browser code that gets run to make things on your webpage moveable and clickable, including the dropdown menus and hover effects you use every day.  It's time to dive in a bit more and start getting your hands dirty with some code.

This is also the first time you'll get to do some actual programming (HTML/CSS just kind of sits there).  The jQuery section will focus a bit more on applying your knowledge to real webpages.

### Assignment:
1. Do [Codecademy's Javascript Sections 1-5](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)("Getting Started with Programming" to "Control Flow"). If you want extra credit, do the full Javascript track... but we'll get to that in-depth later on in the curriculum. [??? hrs]
    * Want to help? [Tell us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) how long that course took so we can let others know!
2. Be sure to do [the Codecademy Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Project](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-x9DnD/0/1) once you've finished the learning section.
3. Go to [jsfiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net/) and play around with their tool -- it lets you type out some HTML, CSS, and Javascript and see it displayed for you right there.  It's great for just testing things out or solving simple problems, though it will feel a bit clunky if you're trying to do a whole project in it.  Use the "Run" button at the top to run your Javascript.
    1. Another in-browser IDE to explore for HTML/CSS/JS is [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/).
    2. You can also try the Javascript section of [Codecademy Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com/) -- it doesn't support HTML and CSS, but it does provide you with a helpful javascript console.
4. Start thinking about how to use code to solve more logical problems. As much as web development is an expression of creativity, it's also based in problem solving (and job interviewers certainly know that) so you'll want to shake the rust off that part of your brain.  [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a series of programming challenges that are best solved by using the power of computers (since many of them require you to perform simple mathematical operations on a very large scale).  Some of the later problems require so much repetition and computing power that you would need to find a more elegant way of solving it than the immediately obvious "brute force" solution.  We'll just do a couple of simpler ones here.  Solve these problems (try using [jsfiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net/) or [Codecademy Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com/) if you aren't comfortable working with your own files):
    1. [Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
    2. [Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers](http://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
    3. [Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor](http://projecteuler.net/problem=3)... just solve for numbers smaller than 100,000 (otherwise it'll take too long with your brute force solution).
    4. No one said you could turn off your brain!

* Reading: The first several sections of the [Javascript 101 tutorial on learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/).
* Interactive: Do the additional sections in the [Codeacademy Javascript Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).

## jQuery:
What about [jQuery](http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/23/jquery/)? It's a library of commonly used javascript widgets and functions that has more or less taken the internet by storm.  It's written in javascript and it means that you don't have to go through the pain of building a popup modal dialog box or a dropdown menu, for example, the long way.  It also gives you the incredibly easy ability to select elements on the webpage ("DOM elements") so you can start modifying their properties, whether that's hiding them, moving them, changing their contents... it's all in your hands!

jQuery will let you take your javascript knowledge and start really diving into your webpages and messing with the elements.

### Assignment:
1. Learn about jQuery by doing [Codecademy's jQuery Track sections 1-3](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)("Introducing jQuery", jQuery Functions", and "Dynamic HTML").
2. If you can't get enough, also give [Code School's try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) a shot (let us know which is better!).
2. The remaining Codecademy sections are, again, extra credit and will be covered later in the curriculum.

Want to help? [Tell us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) how long those courses took and if you liked one much better than the other so we can let others know!

TODO: A video where a dev walks through some existing Javascript/jQuery code and explains how it works and why it's set up the way it is.
