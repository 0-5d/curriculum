# The Cloud, Hosting, and Software as a Service (SAAS)
Estimated Time: ??? hrs

You've almost certainly heard of the Cloud before and have maybe also heard of SAAS.  The Cloud is really just a way of saying "stored out on the Internet somewhere", which really means "stored on someone else's systems that they let us access using the Internet".  With more and more of the world in posession of 24/7 internet access, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  For software, it has been a great thing.

Check out this [explanation of cloud computing](http://mashable.com/2013/08/26/what-is-the-cloud/) from Mashable.

If you want another go at it, take a look at this [explanation of cloud computing](http://www.cnbc.com/id/43077233) from CNBC.

Next, watch the [David Patterson's explanation of Cloud Computing (12:23 to 30:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeBAj4P2FWA&list=PLjbL0BCR04Q3uDPD3GVZJqV3UnJkOic-o) from the Berkeley SAAS course on edX.

Not too long ago, you had to buy a machine, set it up to run your back end code, and plug it into the wall to get it onto the internet.  These days, not only can you host your personal songs and files and emails in the Cloud, but you can actually run your website from servers hosted by someone else (and maybe in another country too).  Companies (like [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), which we will use later) make it so that all you have to do is push some code their way and they'll take care of firing up and maintaining the servers necessary to get that application "live" and online.  They will also guarantee a certain minimum level of uptime (usually well north of 99%) so you don't have to worry about whether your servers have failed.  It means that you as a developer can focus more on building cool applications and less on the nuts and bolts of getting them out there.  This curriculum assumes that you'll be taking advantage of existing cloud hosting, so we won't spend much time teaching you about how to set up your own servers.

Where before you had to write a piece of software that would work on a particular type of computer (e.g. Windows machines running Windows Vista) and then get that user to install the software, now many of these applications are run completely using websites.  Think about Google Spreadsheets or Evernote or TurboTax... all of these can be run completely online (though they often have accompanying downloadable applications to help you out).

The ability to create this "Software as a Service (SAAS)" gives you tons of great flexibility as a developer -- it means you no longer have to think about the dozens of different types of operating systems and versions that the users could be using.  You just make sure your application can be viewed properly by people using a few different web browsers.  Even better, when you inevitably want to make large-scale changes or just fix some bugs, you no longer have to convince your users to go through the painful upgrade process.  Just push the changes to your sever, and Presto!, your application is updated and good to go.  If there's a problem with the new Ford car model, they need to issue a recall and have everyone go to a mechanic to fix it.  You just push some code to fix the bug and sleep happy.

1. Check out this article on the [difference between SAAS and Cloud Computing](http://www.itworld.com/print/109287) if you're confused.
2. There's also another [interesting perspective on SAAS](http://www.itworld.com/print/108695) from a few years ago.
