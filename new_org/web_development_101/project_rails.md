## Do the [Jumpstart Labs Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).

### Extra Credit:

Michael Hartl guides you through [creating a sample app using scaffolding](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top) as the first stage of his Rails tutorial.  Just do chapter 2 -- you'll be doing the rest of the tutorial anyway later on during the Rails unit.  If you aren't comfortable with git, either do the [introductory section on git](/curriculum/curriculum/web_development_basics/web_programming_basics/additional_topics.md) or skip any of the `$ git ... ` commands for now.  They're essential to learn eventually but non-essential right now (it's sort of like saving your files on Dropbox).
