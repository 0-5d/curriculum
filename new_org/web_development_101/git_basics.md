# Git 101
Estimated Time: ??? hrs

We mentioned git briefly in the previous unit ([Becoming a Web Developer](/curriculum/becoming_a_web_developer/)) but this time you'll actually start using it.

If you recall, git is the version control system used by developers.  It means that you can revert to a previous (working) version of the application if you really screwed something up and it means that you have a standardized way of managing a project with contributions from multiple developers.  It's even useful if it's just you and you're working on a project on your own with a few half-baked ideas that you're trying to code at the same time but want to keep separated until they've matured sufficiently.

It sort of feels like if you were typing a text document and, every time you saved it, you entered a summary message like "just finished paragraph on how git works".  Then, if you realize at the end of the day that all your changes are awful and ruin the flow of the document, you could go back to the last save of yesterday and bring the document back to the way it was.

But wait, you say, Why not just erase the offending paragraphs and move on?  Here's where the web application stops resembling a high school essay.  Changes you make to your web application to build some new feature will be scattered in a dozen different files and will likely involve changing existing code at least as much as it involves actually producing new (and easily deleted) code, so having that ability to just reset the clock to a particular point in the past saves you from having to remember exactly what was changed and what it looked like beforehand.  The power of git goes well beyond this simple example, but it should help you start to see why people use it.

## Assignment:

1. Read through Github's [Introduction to Git materials](http://learn.github.com/p/index.html) and watch the video there.
2. Do the quick [Try Git exercises](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) as well.
