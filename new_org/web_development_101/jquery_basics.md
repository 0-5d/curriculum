# jQuery 101
*Estimated Time: 3-5 hrs*

[jQuery](http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/23/jquery/) is a library of commonly used javascript widgets and functions that has more or less taken the internet by storm.  It's written in javascript and it means that you don't have to go through the pain of building a popup modal dialog box or a dropdown menu, for example, the long way.  It also gives you the incredibly easy ability to select elements on the webpage ("DOM elements") so you can start modifying their properties, whether that's hiding them, moving them, changing their contents... it's all in your hands!

jQuery will let you take your javascript knowledge and start really diving into your webpages and messing with the elements.

## You Will Need To Understand:
* What is the DOM?
* How can you interact with the DOM?
* How can you add elements to the DOM?
* How can you modify the contents of an element?

### Assignment:
1. Learn about jQuery by doing [Codecademy's jQuery Track sections 1-3](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)("Introducing jQuery", jQuery Functions", and "Dynamic HTML").
2. If you can't get enough, also give [Code School's try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) a shot (let us know which is better!).
2. The remaining Codecademy sections are, again, extra credit and will be covered later in the curriculum.

Want to help? [Tell us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) how long those courses took and if you liked one much better than the other so we can let others know!

TODO: A video where a dev walks through some existing Javascript/jQuery code and explains how it works and why it's set up the way it is.
