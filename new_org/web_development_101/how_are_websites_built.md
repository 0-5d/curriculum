# How Are Websites Built?

You've got an idea of what the pieces look like, now it's time to see how they all dance together in a typical Ruby on Rails application.  Read through [The Anatomy of a Web Application](http://www.buildingwebapps.com/transcript/79327-anatomy-of-a-web-application) (you can listen to audio of it by clicking the link on the left side) and pay particular attention to what's happening on the client vs the server side.  It gets a bit more into the guts of what Rails is doing, and this will be a valuable first step towards understanding what you'll be building later on.

## Macro Level: From Client to Developer and Back

TODO: client team handoff, scrum, cards/stories, gogo, circle back, scrum.... debrief.

## Micro Level: What You Do as the Developer

TODO: tech used, who gets spoken to, where debugs are usually needed, when tests are written, how deployment goes, interactions with other team members.

*Are you an experienced developer?  We'd love to find out what exactly the life cycle of a project looks like.  Please [email us](mailto:curriculum@theodinproject.com) if we can do a quick interview about it and post it here!  If you know of a good interview on the web that does the same thing, please let us know about that as well.*
