# Basic Data Structures and Algorithms
*Estimated Time: 1-2 hrs*

The basic idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application.  You can usually store data in one giant array, but it can be very time consuming to locate a particular value.  Depending on the application, there are a batch of other basic data structures that you can use to meet your needs.  Often, you end up making trade-offs between various attributes like how long it takes to first populate the structure, how long it takes to add or find elements, and how large the structure is in memory.

We'll save the specifics of data structures for more computer-science-oriented courses, but this introduction should again expand your toolbox slightly so you're much better able to identify and solve certain problems where Arrays, Hashes and Sets don't quite cut it.  This is particularly relevant when you're trying to search through a bunch of data for a particular value or plan out a strategy several moves in advance.

You've already had a chance to be introduced to algorithms and even write your own Merge Sort.  Sorting algorithms are a classic bunch of them.  Another major area for algorithms is in search -- where milliseconds count and you're searching through giant troves of data, the quality of your search algorithm matters a lot.  Traversing a data tree looking for a certain element is another related problem that's common in data intensive applications.

Luckily for you, these problems have all been solved many times in the past.  Understanding how they are solved will give you some great tools to apply to other (similar) problems on your own.  Algorithms are really just ways of solving problems (like this) systematically.  We'll focus on a couple of algorithms that you may run into when coding on your own -- breadth-first-search and depth-first-search.

## You Will Need To Understand:

* What is a data structure?
* What is a stack?
* What is a stack useful for?
* What is a queue?
* What is a queue useful for?
* Why bother having many different search algorithms?
* What is breadth-first-search (BFS)?
* What is depth-first-search (DFS)?
* What situations would you want to use BFS?
* What situations would you want to use DFS instead?
* When would BFS be impractical?

## Homework Assignment

1. Glance over the [Wikipedia entry on Data Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) for a high level overview of things.
2. Learn about Queues and Stacks by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QS_Cup1YoI)
2. Learn about binary search trees by watching [this video](http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/binary_search/binary_search-720p.mp4) from Harvard's CS50x on edX.
1. Learn about basic algorithms from Coursera's Algorithms course in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2TwK3fED8A).  The first 10 minutes are really the meat of the introduction to algorithms, the rest gets more mathematical (if you're so inclined).  
2. Read the [Gentle Introduction to Algorithms for Web Developers](http://www.giocc.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-algorithms-for-web-developers.html) for another basic look at what algorithms are.
3. Finally, learn about Depth First Search and Breadth First Search from [this video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZhSSXAwxI).
