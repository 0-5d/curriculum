# Advanced Building Blocks
*Control Flow, Looping, Arrays, Hashes, Blocks, Sorting*

*Estimated Time: 10-15 hrs*

This section gets more into the topics you may have been shakey on before.  It's definitely got some more meat to it than the previous one.  The projects in the Assignment section are good for doing on your own because Codecademy gives you all kinds of help with them.  

## You Will Need To Understand:

* Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas:

    * How is a block like a function?
    * How is a block different from a function?
    * What are the two ways to declare a block?
    * How do you return data from a block?
    * What happens if you include a `return` statement in a block?
    * Why would you use a block instead of just creating a method?
    * What does `yield` do?
    * How do you pass arguments to a block from within a method?
    * How do you check whether a block was actually passed in?
    * What is a proc?
    * What's the difference between a proc and a block?
    * When would you use a proc instead of a block?
    * What is a closure?
    * What is a lambda?
    * What's different between a lambda and a proc?
    * What is a Method (capital "M")?
    * What do Methods basically allow you to do that could probably be pretty interesting when you're writing some more advanced programs later on?

* Enumerable and Modules

    * What is a module?
    * Why are modules useful?
    * What does `each` do? 
    * What does `each` return?
    * What does `map` do?
    * What does `map` return?
    * What is the difference between `map` and `collect`?
    * What does `select` do?
    * What does `select` return?
    * What is the difference between `each` `map` and `select`?
    * What does `inject` do?
    * When might you use `inject`?
    * How do you check if every item in a hash fulfills a certain criteria?
    * What about if none of the elements fulfill that criteria?
    * What (basically) is an `enumerator`?

* Conditionals and Flow Control

    * What is a "boolean"?
    * What are "truthy" values?
    * Are `nil`, `0`, `"0"`, `""`, `1`, `[]`, `{}` and `-1` considered true or false?
    * When do you use `elsif`?
    * When do you use `unless`?
    * What does `<=>` do?
    * Why might you define your own `<=>` method?
    * What do `||` and `&&` and `!` do?
    * What is returned by `puts("woah") || true`?
    * What is `||=`?
    * What is the ternary operator?
    * When should you use a `case` statement?

* Iteration

    * What does `loop` do?
    * What are the two ways to denote a block of code?
    * What is an index variable?
    * How do you print out each item of a simple array `[1,3,5,7]` with:
        * `loop`?
        * `while`?
        * `for`?
        * `each`?
        * `times`?
    * What's the difference between `while` and `until`?
    * How do you stop a loop?
    * How to you skip to the next iteration of a loop?
    * How would you start the loop over again?
    * What are the (basic) differences between situations when you would use `while` vs `times` vs `each`?
    * What does nesting loops mean and when would you use it?

## Test Yourself

Make sure you can do the [Beginner Ruby Quiz #2](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/76), [Quiz #3](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/77), [Quiz #4](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/78), and [Quiz #6](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/80) from [Code Quizzes](http://www.codequizzes.com/).  They're pretty quick and should give you an idea of what you still need to brush up on.
