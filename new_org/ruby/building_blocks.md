## Homework Assignment:

1. You should have already completed [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) in the Web Development 101 course to start with.
2. Do the full [Codecademy Introduction to Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) section.
3. Complete the [Codecademy Introduction to Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) project ("Putting the Form in Formatter")
4. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 2: `Programming == Joy: A Whistle Stop Tour of Ruby and Object Orientation`
5. Read [Beginning Ruby](http://beginningruby.org/) Chapter 3: `Ruby's Building Blocks: Data, Expressions, and Flow Control` pages 31-50 (only the section on Numbers and Expressions and the section on Text and Strings)
6. Take a look at the [Ruby Date and Time explanation from TutorialsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_date_time.htm).  No need to memorize all the Time Formatting Directives, just know what they are and where to find them.

## Test Yourself

1. Make sure you can do the [Beginner Ruby Quiz #1](http://www.codequizzes.com/topics/24/quizzes/75) from [Code Quizzes](http://www.codequizzes.com/).
2. Make sure you go back up and look at all the questions from the "You Will Need To Understand" section.
