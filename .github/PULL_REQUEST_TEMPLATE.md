Hi there,

I'm using The Odin Project as my primary learning for about 2 months now. I just came around a typo or I think it’s a typo in Web Development 101 JavaScript basics section. In the Event subsection of the DOM Manipulation lesson under ‘attaching listeners to groups of nodes’, there’s a second code block describing how to use forEach method on a nodelist. I think there’s no need to pass ‘e’ as a parameter to the callback function as we’re accessing the button object’s id property, not e’s. I’ve removed e parameter from the code in DOM-manipulation.md file.

Thank you.
