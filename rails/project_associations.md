# Projects: Active Record Associations
*Estimated Time: X hrs*

*Don't forget to use Git to save your projects!*

In these projects, you'll finally really get to dive into ActiveRecord's associations, one of the best features it offers.  The tutorial chapter will have you creating microposts for your users and the other project will give you a chance to add some more interesting associations to your previous work.

## Project 1: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

This chapter of the tutorial begins the conceptual heavy lifting.  For beginners trying to plough through the tutorial, this is usually the beginning of the "I'm doing it but not understanding it" phase. Luckily, you've been able to learn what's actually going on and this should be a great chance to see it in action as part of a real website.

The basic gist of it is that, to have a microposting site like Twitter, you've got to actually have microposts.  Users create microposts, so you can surely expect that a User will `has_many` microposts.  With the association done, the rest is really just about setting up the correct views to display the microposts.  

As with the previous chapter, just make sure you're writing the test specs in the correct files and stick with it.  There's a lot of ground to cover but, again, the conceptual hurdles should be well within reach at this point.
