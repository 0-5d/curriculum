# Projects: Active Record Associations
*Estimated Time: X hrs*

*Don't forget to use Git to save your projects!*

In these projects, you'll finally really get to dive into ActiveRecord's associations, one of the best features it offers.  The tutorial chapter will have you creating microposts for your users and the other project will give you a chance to add some more interesting associations to your previous work.

## Warmup: Thinking Data First

4. You like hosting people for dinner so you want to build a dinner party invitation site.  You'll have users
5. Extra credit (tricky): You and your friends just love posting things and following each other.  How would you set up the models so a user can 

## Project 1: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

This chapter of the tutorial begins the conceptual heavy lifting.  For beginners trying to plough through the tutorial, this is usually the beginning of the "I'm doing it but not understanding it" phase. Luckily, you've been able to learn what's actually going on and this should be a great chance to see it in action as part of a real website.

The basic gist of it is that, to have a microposting site like Twitter, you've got to actually have microposts.  Users create microposts, so you can surely expect that a User will `has_many` microposts.  With the association done, the rest is really just about setting up the correct views to display the microposts.  

As with the previous chapter, just make sure you're writing the test specs in the correct files and stick with it.  There's a lot of ground to cover but, again, the conceptual hurdles should be well within reach at this point.

### Your Task

* Do the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 10](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/user-microposts#top), "User microposts".

## Project 2: Adding Associations
**************************************************************************
Two separate projects, one after validations and one after associations.

1. Project: CLI apps --

2. Rails apps
    2. set up simple associations and validate and query them, seeds file
    2. Set up complex associations, validations, and  uses validations
