*Estimated Time: X hrs*

*Don't forget to use Git to save your projects!*

In these projects, you'll be working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.  

## Project 1: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

We're starting to get into the meaty stuff with the tutorial.  Take your time and pay attention to which file (especially for the specs) you're supposed to be writing in.  A common and frustrating mistake is to put your `describe` block in the wrong place.

You'll implement signin and signout functionality for the user, which opens the door to allow more destructive user behaviors like editing and deleting things (which should only be allowed for a given user or admin).  In Chapter 9, you'll get the chance to implement these functions.

### Your Task
