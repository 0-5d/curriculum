# Projects: Forms

These projects will give you a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.  The tutorial chapter will cover integrating a signup form with your Rails application and providing help if the user enters incorrect information.

## Project 1: Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

* Build a basic form from scratch (can be same app, different controllers or something)
* Build a rails helper form
* Build rails helper form with validations

## Project 2: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

This chapter will take what you now know about forms and make it part of a real application instead of just a learning exercise.  You'll build out the user signup form for the Twitter-clone project and integrate it with the validations you created on the database in the previous chapter.  

### Your Task

1. Do the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 7](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-up#top), "Sign-Up".
