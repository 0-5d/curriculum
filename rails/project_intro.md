# Project: Web Refresher

Estimated Time: 1 hour

## Warmup: RestClient

This is really a warmup -- you'll get a chance to poke around HTTP requests from the command line (IRB actually) and also to play around with a new gem called `rest-client`.  This is a useful (and powerful) gem which helps you make HTTP requests.  You can use it to do the basic stuff we're doing here or much more complicated authentication requests.  

You may find yourself using Rest Client down the road if you need to communicate with another web service that doesn't have an API library already written out for you (which is pretty rare these days).  Or if for some odd reason you get the inclination to test your own API from the command line.

### Your Task

1. Make sure that you've got Rest Client installed, do a $ gem install rest-client`
2. Head into IRB (`$ irb`)
3. `require 'rest-client'`
4. Now you're able to play with the gem.  Read its documentation over in the Github repo [HERE](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client).  You'll end up doing this a whole lot -- using a new gem and going to its repo to check out the documentation, so get familiar with the process early!
5. Use RestClient to do a Google search and examine the results (you can find the parameters that Google wants in the URL after you make a search in a browser.  Ignore everything after `q=`.  Okay, you just need the `q=searchterm` parameter).
6. TODO: POST to a form
