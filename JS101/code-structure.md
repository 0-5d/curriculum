I'm not quite convinced we need this lesson either, but I've come across a few good resources that cover it, so I'm stubbing it out for now.

Let me know what you think

possible resource:
http://javascript.info/structure

We've got something like this already:  https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/dev-knowledge/02-readable-code.md

Let me know if it fits what you had in mind.  If not i can tweak it a bit
