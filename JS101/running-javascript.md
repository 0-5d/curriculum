this lesson describes how to run javascript code in various contexts including online (repl.it, codepen, jsbin), included in an HTML file (on the page and included as a script), in the browser (devtools) and in a terminal (node)

All of these JS environments are useful in their own ways so the lesson should highlight when and why each is appropriate.

short intro to node, couple sentances on using it to run JS files: https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/node%2Bexpress/01-node-1.md
