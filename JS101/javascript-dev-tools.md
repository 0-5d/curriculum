Knowing how to use the Developers Tools inside your browser is an important skill for any web developer.  The Developer Tools are useful for running Javascript code, editing HTML and CSS Styles without having to refresh the page, viewing any data, along with countless other things.  Once you know how to use the Developer Tools you'll wonder how you got along without them.

## Opening Dev Tools

There are three ways to open the Developer Tools menu:
1. Select the Chrome Menu > `More Tools` > `Developer Tools`
2. Right click anywhere on a webpage and select `Inspect`
3. Use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL + Shift + I` (`option + command + I` on Mac)
